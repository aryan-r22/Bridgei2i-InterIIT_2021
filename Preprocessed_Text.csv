4,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) The Delhi High Court Monday sought to know whether US-based e-commerce giant Amazon and Kishore Biyani led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) were open to resolving the issue arising out of Rs 24,713 crore deal between FRL and Reliance Retail.The counsel for both, Amazon and Future Group, submitted that they would seek instructions and inform the court on Tuesday.The court was hearing a plea by Amazon seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore's Emergency Arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea, also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged 'wilful disobedience' of the emergency arbitrator's order.Justice J R Midha asked the parties to inform it on Tuesday if any such endeavour could be made and clarified that this should not be taken as deferring the proceedings and it would continue as scheduled. The court, which asked if any attempt has been made to resolve the issue, suggested that if parties would be willing, it can refer the matter to two retired judges of the Supreme Court.The court also said it will consider whatever protective order can be passed.In commercial matters, it is always helpful to find a solution,” it said.To this, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing Amazon, said he will take instructions on it as nothing tangible has happened.Senior advocate Darius Khambata, representing FRL, also said he will take instructions and inform the court.Amazon has approached the high court seeking to restrain Kishore Biyani-led Future Group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.It also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL's retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon.Story continuesThe Future Group and Amazon have been locked in a battle after the US-based company took FRL into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.The three domestic firms -- FRL, FCPL and Reliance -- have however contended before the high court that if Amazon's claim -- that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL -- was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.According to Amazon, the EA award passed under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules is enforceable under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.It referred to an order passed by the high court on December 21, 2020, prima facie holding that the EA's award was valid under the Indian law.Senior advocate Harish Salve, also representing FRL, had earlier submitted that Amazon had a deal with FCPL and signed an agreement with Biyani. FCPL has a shareholding agreement with FRL which has no agreement with Amazon.Subramanium had urged that FRL shall not further precipitate the situation as the matter is being heard by the court.In the petition, Amazon has alleged that Future Group, Kishore Biyani and other promoters and directors have “deliberately and maliciously disobeyed” the EA award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.“The majority respondents' action of simply ignoring the order (of EA) and continuing with the impugned transaction (deal) is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts, the rule of law and the administration of justice..,” it said.It sought to injunct Future Group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with Reliance.In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.The SIAC on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.Subsequently, Amazon wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator's interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.As per the SIAC interim order, a three-member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days (from the date of the judgement) with one judge each being appointed by Future and Amazon, along with a third neutral judge.On November 10, 2020, Amazon had told the court that it and FCL have appointed their respective arbitrators.

5,"Express News ServiceHousing for all and affordable housing were termed priority areas in Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget. The Union Budget proposed extension of interest deduction for home buyers and tax holidays on affordable housing projects for one more year.""In the July 2019 Budget, I provided an additional deduction of interest, amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, for loan taken to purchase an affordable house. I propose to extend the eligibility of this deduction by one more year, to 31st March 2022,"" Sitharaman said in her budget speech.Jaxay Shah, Chairman, CREDAI National, said this move will boost overall demand for affordable housing, which has been the fastest growing segment for the real estate sector. Anuj Puri, Chairman - ANAROCK Property Consultants, said these steps will keep demand buoyant for affordable housing in 2021 as well. Further, the extension of the tax holiday for affordable housing projects for one more year will help bring in more new supply within this segment.As per ANAROCK Research, affordable housing already accounts for more than 35 per cent of the supply across the top seven cities in the country.The budget also proposed amendments to allow debt funding through estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO - India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE said, ""Proposing to make dividend payments to REIT (estate investment trusts) and Infrastructure investment trusts exempt from TDS this year is another great move as it will be helpful in addressing the liquidity situation in the real estate industry. Debt Financing of InVITs and REITs by Foreign Portfolio Investors has been enabled by suggesting amendments in the relevant legislations. This is likely to ease access of finance to InVITS and REITs thus augmenting funds for the infrastructure and real estate sector.""However, the industry at large felt ignored as most of its demands did not find a mention in Sitharaman's budget.Surendra Hiranandani, Chairman and Managing Director, House of Hiranandani, said the government could have given a further boost to the real estate sector. ""There have been many pressing concerns in the real sector that have not been addressed such as easing liquidity, reduction in levies/taxes, tax deductions on home loans to give impetus to buyer sentiment, granting of industry status to the overall real estate sector and implementation of single window clearance amongst others,"" said Hiranandani.Shah of Credai also said that popular demands for changes in IT slabs, increasing the limit of 80C, lower home loan interest rates etc were not announced in the budget. Steps required to ensure more money in the hands of taxpayers to encourage spending were also not addressed.Lindsay Bernard Rodrigues, Co-Founder and Director, Bennet & Bernard Group, said the sector needed many more interventions on the demand side for meaningful growth. He added, ""The Indian real estate sector is the most highly taxed with the combination of high direct and indirect taxes, stamp duties and levies for development approvals which have been crippling growth. A key expectation was the restoration of income tax benefit on a second home which would have benefitted home buyers in a big way and stimulated the real estate sector. It was also important to bring back the input tax credit as part of GST reforms and lower GST rates for purchase of raw materials which would have helped reduce the cost of construction."""

A new study indicates that diabetes during pregnancy may increase the risk of heart disease.The study suggests that women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are twice as likely by mid-life to develop calcium in heart arteries -- a strong predictor of heart disease -- even if healthy blood sugar levels were attained many years after pregnancy.""We were surprised to discover that women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of heart artery calcification, even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy,"" said co-author Erica P.Gunderson from Kaiser Permanente in California, US.For the study, published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association, the team enrolled approximately 1,100 women without Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who subsequently gave birth at least once during the 25-year study period, which ended in 2011.Blood tests were performed from before to after pregnancies at five-year intervals to determine if women had normal blood sugar levels, intermediate elevations in blood sugar levels (pre-diabetes) or they had developed overt Type 2 diabetes.Heart scans were performed to measure coronary artery calcium, a strong predictor for heart disease, at exams 15, 20 and 25 years after the baseline, the first exam of the study.At the 25-year follow-up, the participants' median age was 48 years, and 12 per cent of the women in the study had a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes.The prospective analysis found that women with a history of gestational diabetes had a two-fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification whether they had healthy blood sugar levels, pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes.Of women with previous gestational diabetes, 36 per cent developed pre-diabetes and 26 per cent developed Type 2 diabetes, compared to 35 per cent and 9 per cent of women with no history of gestational diabetes, the researchers said.--IANSvc/bg.Source: IANS"

There are few key announcements in the budget that will support growth for major industries who all are struggling due to challenges from the ongoing pandemic. FM's announcement to boost 6 major areas during the budget will support for our economy to recover in the year 2021. ICT industry plays a very important role in the growth of the economy for our country, and now when the budget is presented to the people of India, there are reactions from the industry leaders. The tech leaders have shared their views with Digital Terminal. Read below the opinion:“The 35% Increase in Capital Spending On Infrastructure, Spells The Biggest Budget Highlight”Rajesh Gupta, Country Manager & Director – India Sales, Micron“The 35% increase in capital spending on infrastructure, spells the biggest budget highlight. I see this investment of catalyzing a virtuous of investment, growth and jobs.

There are several areas where the honourable Finance Minister has announced allocations of funds. This year the government aims to spend Rs 1.97 lakh crore on various PLI schemes over the next 5 years, starting this fiscal. This is in addition to the Rs 40,951 crore announced for the PLI for electronic manufacturing schemes which will accelerate growth opportunities for the industry. And, we look forward to a complete policy and leveraging the same to kickstart domestic manufacturing.""“Extensive Research And Development, And Major Infrastructure Developments Are Definitely The Need Of The Hour”Dipesh Kaura, General Manager, Kaspersky (South Asia)""The budget for FY 2021- 22 was one with the aim to achieve and enhance our country's top priorities, by investing in the healthcare sector and major infrastructures. Enhanced healthcare systems, extensive research and development, and major infrastructure developments are definitely the need of the hour and have been effectively taken care of by the budget allocation set by our FM. The goal to empower 15000 schools and adapt to a hybrid education model is also a very promising step taken towards the digital transformation of the country. However, to make this a success, securing the hybrid education system is equally important, especially in the near future. While pursuing a hybrid model of learning (in-person and remote), the educational sector continues to attract the attention of cybercriminals on the Internet. From July to December 2020, 270,171 users globally encountered various threats disguised as popular learning platforms—an increase of 60% when compared to the first half of 2020. These numbers state the growing need for cybersecurity and why it is important to build a robust and secure digital infrastructure for the education sector.“Similarly, cybersecurity tools will also be needed for the seamless functioning of advanced technologies like deep analytics and artificial intelligence that the government plans to use to identify tax evaders, fake billers and for the digital census. The newer technologies can be used considerably for sectors like BFSI, healthcare, education, and can help in extensive R&D, provided that they are used with utmost security so as to avoid their misuse by cybercriminals who are capable of creating more chaos than one can expect. It will be interesting to see India's education and other sectors further progressing towards digitalisation in the next 1-2 years, and cybersecurity experts and companies like us will be glad to help the country secure this digital future at every step taken forward.""“Focus On Innovation And R&D Lays Down Strong Foundation In Building A Self-Reliant Digital India”Supria Dhanda, Vice President and Country Manager for India, Western Digital“I would like to congratulate the Government on its first paperless budget to push India in its digital journey.

14,"The parable of ‘blind men and an elephant’ increasingly seems to represent India’s agriculture policies, just as it previously did for India’s Industrialization.Planning in silos coupled with tenured postings has denied India policy continuity, accountability and efficacy. Despite overwhelming precedence, Indian policy makers have failed to recognise that ensuring rural growth demands a multipronged policy thrust. Over 55% India resides in villages. Shifting rural youth to industrial or construction jobs; innovation in sustainable farm technologies, finance and productivity; vocational education and training and finally storage, logistics and accessible markets must all tango in tandem. Only then does rural growth move the wheels of consumption resulting in sustained GDP growth.Japan, Taiwan and Korea followed the British model to get their villages engaged in a bottom up manufacturing value chain. This resulted in improved grounds up process innovation, increasing productivity and increased rural household incomes.China’s policy pragmatism, within 35 years, pulled 850 million people out of poverty through grounds up development. Within China, rewarding meritocracy and ensuring policy continuity, despite political transitions, was ensured. Rural development policies ensured rural bank credit access, vocational training, gender equality, nutrition and healthcare push. In its first six years of opening up from 1979, over 23.5 million rural youth found employment. By 1995 numbers had catapulted to 135 million, while vocational training had been imparted to more than half its youth. This constituted China’s productive and low cost industrial spine. Simultaneously, Chinese urbanization and housing thrust engaged millions of youth in infrastructure and construction jobs. Lack of labour laws, and devaluing yuan in 1994, rushed global investments to barter inflation free western growth through cheaper Chinese goods. This surged China’s exports, GDP and employment.In agriculture, China invested billions of dollars in enhancing yields through seed and process innovations. Direct farm subsidy provided on per hectare basis, ensured farmers freedom to grow and amounted to more than $20 billion two years ago. China’s innovation driven productivity in most crops is almost double of India’s. Such policy pragmatism has benefitted 800 million Chinese farmers directly resulting in the biggest human income upgrade in world history. India’s GDP was greater than China’s till 1970. India’s small land holdings, poor farm processes, illiteracy and lack of irrigation, process and innovation thrust has traditionally left farmers rain God dependent. India’s shame during PL-480 imports, led to food grain self-sufficiency through green revolution(GR) initiatives. No efforts were however made to undo the adverse impact of this revolution on soil fertility, fertilizer overdependence, loss of genetic diversity. Lack of irrigation connectivity resulted in huge depletion of ground water aquifers. GR success overwhelmed our focus on balanced diet through nutrition per capita. Ignoring concepts like scaling of farm yield and produce size standardization cost India global market access. Minimum support price benefitted less than 10% of high end farmers, denying equity to small and marginal ones.Meanwhile, India’s industrial policies failed to draw rural youth into employment, thus increasing poverty pressure on growing rural households. This is the genesis of social rural conflicts across India.India’s socialist tilt denied it access to western global industry or agricultural supply chains for inflow or upgradation of technologies. Lack of trained and low cost manpower reduced our export promotion policy to licence procurement and import manipulations.In fact, India’s liberalisation story is direct opposite of China. Post 1991, industrial employment plummeted while imports and economy grew. Growing figures in industries hid the ugly fact that average employment remained stagnant around 2 persons per unit, till 2004.Drastic import tariffs cuts, reduced most manufacturers into becoming import dependent. India’s obtuse labour laws, inspector raj and plethora of compliances ensured that industries shed jobs to employ machines. India’s policy’s fascination for large industries for creating jobs, was totally misplaced as large units preferred automation rather than labour strikes. In the name of labour protection policies, India killed labour accountability, productivity and serious greenfield investments. Lessons from west and east on generating employment via small industries were totally ignored. Policy euphoria over growth in services overlooked the fact that services cannot replace manufacturing for providing bulk employment. Instead, India’s services sector growth upset the wage equilibrium across manufacturing industries. Liberalisation wiped out many of local, yet globally competitive industries. All these reduced India into becoming import"
15,"The proposal to increase customs duty on certain imported automotive parts in the Union Budget 2020-21 will lead to increase in car prices, according to Merecedes-Benz India and Skoda Auto Volkswagen, even as component makers said the step will encourage local manufacturing of such items.The government on Monday proposed an increase in customs duty on certain imported components used in automobiles.In the Budget 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed increase in customs duty of various parts, including ignition wiring sets, safety glass and parts of signalling equipment to 15 per cent with effect from February 2.The parts would also attract agriculture infrastructure and development cess at the rate of 5 per cent.Currently, the parts attract customs duty in the range of 7.5-10 per cent.""The increase in the rise in auto component duties is unexpected in such a revival period, and it will increase the production cost, leading to higher cost for consumers,"" Mercedes-Benz India Managing Director and CEO Martin Schwenk said in a statement.Besides, there could have been further push towards e-mobility by lowering import duties on electric vehicles, he added.Similarly, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India Managing Director Gurpratap Boparai said the increase in customs duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent will further increase input costs and prices for cars which depend on specialised components which cannot be manufactured locally due to unviable volumes.It is important to keep in mind that even in the coming financial year, the passenger vehicle market is unlikely to reach the level of 2018 and the much-required rationalisation of GST and cess to aid the auto industry was missing, he added.Both Schwenk and Boparai however welcomed the announcement of scrappage policy.The government said the changes in basic customs duty is for creating level-playing fields for the benefit of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other domestic manufacturers.""We are raising custom duty on certain auto parts to 15 per cent to bring them on par with the general rate of auto parts,"" Sitharaman said in her Budget speech.Automotive Component Manufacturers Association President Deepak Jain said the increase in basic customs duty on select auto components will encourage local manufacturing of such items.Hailing the announcement of the scrappage policy, he noted that the announcements with regards increased spend on road infrastructure, voluntary scrappage policy, research and development and PLI among others, augur well for the automotive sector.Similarly, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) President Vinkesh Gulati said if 1990 is taken as a base year, there were around 37 lakh commercial vehicles and 52 lakh passenger vehicles eligible for voluntary scrapping.""We still need to see the fine prints to access the kind of incentives which will be on offer and thus have a positive effect on retail,"" he added.Hyundai Motor India Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) SS Kim said the proposed vehicle scrappage policy will provide thrust towards procurement of new automobiles and have a strong positive effect giving a boost to Atmanirbhar Bharat.Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek said voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles, augmenting public transport system in urban areas, continuing focus on adoption of cleaner fuels, and enhancing outlays for developing road infrastructure are positive steps for the auto industry.Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) Vice Chairman Vikram Kirloskar said the long-awaited scrapping policy could contribute to lower fuel consumption, lessen pollution while also generating additional demand for cleaner new vehicles.""The auto sector welcomes this announcement and is hopeful that for realising full benefits there will be an early and full implementation of this policy,"" he added.Similarly, Honda Cars India Senior Vice President & Director (Marketing and Sales) Rajesh Goel said the scrappage policy was one of the long-awaited announcements for the auto sector.Expressing similar views, Renault India Operations Country CEO and Managing Director Venkatram Mamillapalle said the policy will significantly reduce pollution and should help bolster demand for new vehicles in the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors.Mahindra & Mahindra MD and CEO Pawan Goenka said: ""Though details are not yet out, when the policy comes out, it should have full incentive for scrapping and not just disincentive for not scrapping.""The Union has several positive signals for the manufacturing sector and the commercial vehicles (CV) sector, which are core to the economy, Ashok Leyland MD and CEO Vipin Sondhi said.The Rs 18,000-crore scheme to augment public transport in urban areas with the addition of 20,000 new buses in a PPP model would ensure cleaner and efficient public transportation and ease congestion, he added.Apollo Tyres Chairman Onkar S Kanwar als"
16,"The finance minister had promised that this post-covid Budget will be like “one never seen before"". And she and the government have delivered. Acknowledging the severity of the economic loss, this is every bit a growth-oriented Budget as we could ever have expected. Yet, with fiscal prudence temporarily in abeyance, there is a commitment to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act and fiscal consolidation over the next five years.A couple of measures are significant in scope and even radical: increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) limits for insurance firms from the existing 49% to 74%, as well as permitting foreign ownership and control, and particularly the proposal to privatize two public sector banks and one general insurance company.In addition, the budget presents a compelling vision under the rubric of Atmanirbhar Bharat, seeking to leverage multiple proposals to boost both investment and demand. As a package, these will take India to a sustained high-growth path in the medium term. These include an aggressive roadmap for monetization of the government’s physical and financial assets, increased focus on affordable housing to boost the long backward and forward construction linkages, and measures to attract foreign capital, including tax holidays and exemptions for aircraft leasing companies at the GIFT City. Expenditure on health and well-being is proposed to be increased by 137%.Growth and revenue assumptions are also realistic. Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY22 is forecast at 14.4%, which is likely to be an underestimate and, therefore, will help the fiscal maths.Infrastructure capex is a key thrust area for the budget. Outlay on capital expenditures will increase to ₹5.54 trillion in FY22 from ₹4.12 trillion budgeted in FY21 (now revised up to ₹ 4.39 trillion). These spends will be augmented by financing from the Development Financial Institution proposed to provide long-term debt financing for infrastructure projects.Following on with the measures to incentivize credit offtake, which have been a key pillar of the post-pandemic stimulus measures, the budget proposes asset reconstruction and management companies to take over existing stressed loans of public sector banks and then sell them to potential investors. While details of the structure and capitalization of these companies are awaited, and several thorny issues, such as valuations of the assets to be transferred, are awaited, this can potentially help to clean up bank books and increase credit offtake from a significant share of the banking sector. The budgeted allocation of ₹20,000 crore for PSB recapitalization will also help.In addition to the higher spends to support growth, the budget has also sought to improve sentiment and confidence. Reducing the window for reopening tax assessments from the present six years to three years, while limiting tax assessments in serious evasion cases only with concurrence of the highest-ranking tax officer will reduce uncertainty. The result of the progressive simplifications in filing tax returns has resulted in a large increase in returns filed over the past six years.The budget attempts to further increase transparency. At least one large off-balance sheet item, small savings loans to Food Corp. of India for food subsidy, will now have a direct budgetary allocation. This is a further advance from the measure of enhanced disclosures in earlier budgets of borrowings by government agencies to fund the government of India schemes. This also partially explains the significant increase in spending announced in both the FY21 and FY22 Budgets.There will be challenges in implementing the ambitious measures. Steps for fiscal consolidation to meet the target of a fiscal deficit less than 4.5% by FY26 will have to be thought out and implemented vigorously. On the revenue side, this will entail rising tax compliance, aggressive disinvestment and asset monetization, realizing taxes that are stuck in litigation and disputes. On the expenditure side, there will have to be expenditure rationalization to increase spending efficiencies.This is one of the quinquennial budgets which coincide with the tabling of a Finance Commission report. More than ever before, federalism – fiscal as well as other dimensions – has become one of the crucial pillars for implementing reforms.Note that the Agri Infra cess on petrol and diesel is price-neutral for consumers, being a replacement of a tax with a cess and not an additional charge and, hence, will not add to inflation. However, the higher spends entail a borrowing programme higher than expected. This will need to be managed, since the support from banks will likely be lower in FY22, with expected increase in credit demand. The Reserve Bank of India will need to lend support to manage any undue rise in bond yields and significant market disruptions, although it too will be constrained with the need to gradually drain liquidity over the next year"

Is he good enough to play for Arsenal?"" the Eagles boss told the media on Monday. ""Yes, but it would be a real surprise to me.""Ainsley Maitland-Niles filled in for Tierney when the Scotland international missed the 0-0 draw with Palace in the Premier League on January 14th through injury, but Arteta doesn't have many other options in a key position of the field.It was suggested that Sead Kolasinac's return to Schalke earlier this month would force the Gunners to dip into the transfer market for fresh blood, but Martin Odegaard and Matt Ryan have been the only new arrivals so far, on loan deals from Real Madrid and Brighton respectively.Arteta did not rule out further signings during his latest press conference, telling reporters: ""The last day of the transfer window is always unpredictable so things can happen. They might happen, they might not happen. We are on it.”Arsenal are due back in top-flight action on Tuesday night, with a trip to Molineux to face Wolves on the cards. Arteta's side were held to a 0-0 draw by Manchester United in their last outing, but are now unbeaten in their last six Premier League games."
19,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) Agri and food companies on Monday hailed the decision to hike farm credit target and increase allocation for the agriculture ministry in the Budget, saying this will help in boosting farmers' income and overall growth of the sector.Asserting that the government is committed towards farmers' welfare, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday proposed 10 per cent hike in the farm loan disbursal target to Rs 16.5 lakh crore, and introduced an agri infra and development cess of up to 100 per cent to create post-harvest infrastructure for improving farmers' income.The minister also proposed higher allocation for Rural Infrastructure Development Fund and Micro Irrigation Fund, and extended Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to APMCs for augmenting infrastructure facilities.""2020 has been a year of exceptional and unprecedented challenges and has highlighted the critical importance of two core sectors, agriculture and healthcare. The Union Budget 2021 has correctly called out the role of these two sectors in leading the nation's recovery and being catalysts to sustainable growth,"" said D Narain, Senior Bayer Representative, South Asia and CEO & MD, Bayer CropScience.Higher allocations for both healthcare and agriculture with specific focus on building public health infrastructure, expansion of credit to farmers, additional allocation for rural infrastructure and micro irrigation are welcome moves, he said.""These initiatives complement actions already initiated to double farmers' incomes and enabling wider healthcare access for the nation,"" Narain added.Ram Kaundinya, Director General, Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII), said it is a status quo budget for agriculture in general and for seed industry in particular.""Agriculture contributed significantly to our successful fight against COVID. But the sector did not get the needed attention in the budget. No transformative measures have been proposed,"" he said.On the positives, Kaundinya said an increase in agricultural credit to Rs 16.5 lakh crore will help farmers in accessing more credit and Rs 10,000 crore for micro irrigation is also a good measure.""Increasing import duty on cotton is a good measure that should help in improving domestic prices although we are no longer a major cotton importer. We are actually the largest exporter in the world, courtesy Bt Cotton driven increase in cotton production,"" he said.Output marketing related measures like extending eNAM (National Agriculture Market) to 1,000 more mandis and making Agri Infrastructure Fund available for upgrading infrastructure in APMCs are welcome, FSII said.On disappointments, Kaundinya said investments in research in agriculture are not addressed, especially since research and innovation is one of the six pillars of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and there is a need to scale up private sector investments in agricultural research.Seed industry was expecting restoration of 200 per cent tax deduction of research expenses but it has not been met, he added.The industry expected a major project to invest in scaling up domestic oilseeds production through incentives for farmers, use of modern technologies in crops like mustard, soybean and groundnut would be announced with an eye on reducing huge imports of edible oils, he said.Maithili Appalwar, CEO, Avana, said: ""The proposed outlay of Rs 2.87 lakh crore under the Jal Jeevan Mission supports our vision of water conservation and sanitation. With agriculture taking a centre stage in this year's Budget, we appreciate the government's pragmatic measures of an influx of Rs 10,000 crore as part of the micro irrigation corpus fund, a double since last fiscal.""Announcement of the agriculture credit target of Rs 16.5 lakh crore for FY22, green scheme as well as an increase in provision to rural infra development fund to Rs 40,000 crore from Rs 30,000 crore will ensure the spur in development and growth for farmers, Appalwar said.Asitava Sen, CEO of CropLife India, the apex body of agrochemical industries, said: ""The government's continued focus and commitment on doubling farmers' income by 2022 is very evident in the 2021 Union Budget.""With a view to reduce overall cost of production for farmers, he said the GST on agrochemicals could have been reduced from the current 18% to 12%.""Further, the Government should provide 200% weighted deduction on R&D expenses by agrochemical companies to encourage innovation and introduction of new technologies,"" Sen said.(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)"

The Union Budget 2021 has correctly called out the role of these two sectors in leading the nation''s recovery and being catalysts to sustainable growth,"" said D Narain, Senior Bayer Representative, South Asia and CEO & MD, Bayer CropScience.Higher allocations for both healthcare and agriculture with specific focus on building public health infrastructure, expansion of credit to farmers, additional allocation for rural infrastructure and micro irrigation are welcome moves, he said.""These initiatives complement actions already initiated to double farmers'' incomes and enabling wider healthcare access for the nation,"" Narain added.Ram Kaundinya, Director General, Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII), said it is a status quo budget for agriculture in general and for seed industry in particular.""Agriculture contributed significantly to our successful fight against COVID.

29,"Parcel locker company InPost SA has clinched a five-year deal with Amazon Inc. as the U.S. giant enters Poland’s revved up $19 billion e-commerce market.Fresh from last week’s successful initial public offering, InPost Chief Executive Officer Rafal Brzoska revealed the contract in an interview with Bloomberg. The Amsterdam-listed company will handle some Amazon deliveries in Poland through its network of automated lockers as well as directly to homes, he said.The deal, which doesn’t cover shipments abroad, will help maintain InPost’s revenues if Amazon eats into the dominant position of Allegro.eu SA, the east European country’s e-commerce leader and the biggest client for its parcel lockers. The Polish company is boosting capacity to accommodate what it expects to be a gradual ramp-up of operations by the U.S. giant.“We expect our friends from Amazon to pace their entry -- this is not going to be a Blitzkrieg,” Brzoska, 43, said by phone. Amazon’s step is “very positive, because it means increased volumes. For the entire market, it means faster e-commerce penetration.”InPost shares gained as much as 3.1% and traded 1% higher at 10:42 a.m. in Amsterdam, while Allegro dropped 5.1% in Warsaw before recouping most losses. The Amazon-InPost deal shows that the U.S. giant has “serious plans” for Poland, and making use of a delivery method often preferred by Poles may help it grow, Erste Group Bank AG’s analyst Konrad Grygo said.Lifestyle ChangeAmazon last week invited sellers to start registering for its new Polish website that will go live soon. The move coincided with InPost’s market debut via a 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion) IPO which turned Brzoska into a billionaire. The company jumped 24% since its listing and is worth 9.9 billion euros.InPost, which has more than 10,000 lockers, plans to add 4,000 to 5,000 more this year, predicting market growth after better-than-expected volumes in the fourth quarter. The company isn’t changing its mid-term capex plan of as much as 625 million zloty ($168 million) per year after Amazon’s decision, the CEO said.Brzoska is betting that Poles’ embrace of online shopping is a lifestyle change that will outlast the pandemic and that the eventual lifting of virus-related restrictions won’t be a big hit for InPost’s business model.InPost shrugs off competition risk from companies that seek to encroach on its home turf, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s AliExpress, Poland’s post office and state-run refiner and retailer PKN Orlen SA. Even as these companies may install as many as 5,000 lockers in Poland over next few years, they would still lack the technology to undermine InPost’s position, he said.Tech TandemWhile clinching the Amazon agreement, whose business or financial details haven’t been published, Brzoska remains confident about InPost’s relationship with Allegro.eu.The two companies signed a seven-year delivery deal in September, even as Polish marketplace plans to launch its own machines. Brzoska wants to see such step as diversification only. About 70% of Allegro’s merchandise go through InPost lockers.“We created a tandem that has generated the biggest tech IPOs in Europe,” he said. “We achieved so much together already and I believe we can achieve even more.”Erste’s Grygo said he expects the entry of Amazon to potentially push Allegro toward foreign expansion so it can maintain its rapid growth.Brzoska is also looking to expand in western Europe. InPost wants to double its U.K. network of automated lockers to 2,000 machines this year. In France, where about 40% of all online purchases are delivered through the out-of-home model, it will seek to buy logistic companies running pick-up and delivery chains in early 2021.He said the pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of the western European model based on pick-up and drop-off points located in convenience stores or in cafés, which became overwhelmed during peak shopping seasons. That creates a lifetime opportunity for InPost.“Merchants in Western Europe have reached their limits,” Brzoska said. “Pick-up points can serve about 20-40 parcels a day while our lockers even 700. Polish merchants have learned their lesson, now it’s time for Western Europe.”"
30,"About 1,500 of the initial volunteers in a late-stage clinical trial of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine were given the wrong dose, but weren’t informed that a mistake had been made after the blunder was discovered, documents obtained by Reuters show.Instead, the dosing mishap was presented to the trial participants in a letter dated June 8 as an opportunity for University of Oxford researchers to learn how well the vaccine works at different doses. The letter was signed by the trial’s chief investigator, Oxford professor Andrew J. Pollard, and sent to the trial subjects.Read | EU regulator authorises AstraZeneca vaccine for all adultsAs Reuters reported on Dec. 24, participants were given about a half dose due to a measuring mistake by Oxford researchers. The Pollard letter didn’t acknowledge any error. Nor did it disclose that researchers had reported the issue to British medical regulators, who then told Oxford to add another test group to receive the full dose, in line with the trial’s original plan.There is no suggestion there was any risk to the health of trial participants.Much is riding on the British-developed vaccine, which is being rolled out across the UK and has been touted as a low-cost weapon against the pandemic. The jab has come under scrutiny because of the dosing error in the Oxford trial and a paucity of data about its efficacy in older people who are most vulnerable to the virus.Reuters shared the letter – which it obtained from the university through a Freedom of Information request – with three different experts in medical ethics. The ethicists all said it indicates the researchers may not have been transparent with trial participants. Volunteers in clinical trials are supposed to be kept fully informed about any changes.“They are not clear at all about what they need to be clear about – what’s going on, what they knew, the rationale for undertaking further research,” said Arthur L. Caplan, founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “It is lost in a snowstorm of verbiage.”Steve Pritchard, a spokesman for Oxford, told Reuters: “The half-dose group was unplanned, but we did know in advance that there was a discrepancy in the dose measurements and discussed this with the regulators before dosing and when the dosing was revised.”Pritchard also said, “We have not stated that a dosing error occurred.”Pollard didn’t respond to a request for comment.The spokesman’s suggestion that no error was made is contradicted by documents produced last year by Oxford and its vaccine partner, drugs giant AstraZeneca PLC. In December, Reuters reported that a “Global Statistical Analysis Plan” by Oxford/AstraZeneca, dated Nov. 17 and later published in the scientific journal The Lancet, called the dosing discrepancy “a potency miscalculation.”A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment.The Health Research Authority, a British government agency responsible for approving medical research and ensuring it is ethical, said in a statement that changes to the study design and the letter sent to participants were approved by one of its ethics committees.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine recently has received authorization for use in a growing number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the European Union and India. The UK became the first country to approve it, and began rolling out the vaccine on January 4.But questions surrounding the clinical trials continue to plague the vaccine. Last week, Germany’s vaccine committee recommended it should only be given to people aged under 65, while the EU, which authorized it on Friday for people aged 18 and over, lowered its reported efficacy rate from 70.4% to 60%. In both cases, authorities cited a lack of sufficient data from the clinical trials. The EU also has sharply criticized AstraZeneca for cutting back its planned vaccine deliveries to the continent over the next few months. The company has said it is doing its best to boost supplies.The mistaken half-dose – which prompted the letter in June to trial participants – continues to be a factor in the reported efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.Oxford had reported interim results in November that showed the efficacy rate for trial subjects who mistakenly received a half-dose and a subsequent full-dose booster shot was 90%, and that the rate for those who received two full doses was 62%. Combining data from the two dosing regimens resulted in an efficacy of 70.4%.In authorizing the vaccine, UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), accepted the pooled results, but didn’t approve administering the half-dose/full-dose regimen. “There is not persuasive evidence of a real difference in” vaccine efficacy between the two different dosing regimens, it said.“RECENT CHANGES”The vaccine’s late-stage clinical trial began on May 28. Within days, Oxford researchers realized trial participants had been given lower doses"

35,"MUMBAI: Benchmark equity indices soared over 5 per cent each as investors were relieved that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not raise taxes in the Union Budget for 2021-22, and instead, chose to pump-prime the economy through higher capital expenditure and cleaning up of the banking sector books.“This is not a populist Budget, there is no major attempt to redistribute incomes by increasing taxes on high income groups, as was the case earlier,” said Prabhat Awasthi, managing director and country head India, Nomura.The Nifty 50 index ended 4.7 per cent or 646.6 points higher at 14,281.0, while the BSE Sensex closed at 48,600.61 points, up 5 per cent or 2,314.8 points.In the broader market, the Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices also showed strength, ending 3.3 per cent and 2.0 per cent higher, respectively.Here are the major movers in today’s session:The Nifty Bank index was the biggest winner of the day, as it soared 8.3 per cent after the finance minister announced the formation of an asset management and reconstruction company to clean up the sector’s balance sheets, while the pro-cyclical colour of the Budget also raised hopes of strong credit growth.Shares of infrastructure-related stocks from the road, cement, capital goods and ancillary sectors saw sharp gains during the session, as the finance minister announced a better-than-expected outlay on capital expenditure for the next fiscal year. The Nifty Infrastructure index ended 5 per cent higher.Shares of IDBI Bank surged over 11 per cent on the finance minister’s announcement of privatisation of two state-owned banks. Investors were of the perception that the lender was the obvious candidate to be privatised.Shares of ITC surged nearly 7 per cent as lack of announcements by the finance minister on cigarette taxes and the new cigarette policy brought relief to investors. The gains were largely driven by traders who had taken short positions in the stock prior to the Budget, covering their positions.Shares of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and others rose after the finance minister said the foreign direct investment limit in the sector will be raised to 74 per cent from 49 per cent with management control.As many as 31 stocks on the National Stock Exchange gave buy signals based on MACD indicators, including ICICI Bank, NALCO, Container Corporation of India and Colgate Palmolive India.Traders aggressively bought the Nifty call options of 14,800 and 15,000 strike prices, expiring on Thursday, suggesting that they expect today’s rally to continue in the coming sessions.“We expect this budget rally to extend further however participants should be selective in their approach now. Going ahead, global cues and corporate earnings would also be on the radar. The way the banking index moved on the budget day, we feel it could lead the next leg of the rally alongside infra counters,” said Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking."
36,"Reddit users and other social media groups take on Wall Street. Photo: STRF/Star Max/IPX/APReddit’s storming of the stock market has sparked jitters among professional investors about the fundamental strength of the market, with bubble talk spiking over the last week.Reddit users from the r/WallStreetBets forum last week masterminded a short squeeze on professional investors that were betting against stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC), forcing several hedge funds to swallow billions in losses. The action moved to the silver (SI=F) market on Monday.The events have spiked anxiety among professional investors, with concerns that the stress could spread to the broader market. Some investors were already convinced that a bubble had formed and think this new band of retail warriors could pop it.“Market commentators point to increasing signs of froth as evidence that the equity market is in the late stage of a bubble, which is set to burst soon,” Bank of America’s European equity strategy team wrote in a recent note.Echoes of dotcom bubbleAfter slumping in March as the pandemic first struck, US stock markets surged to record highs last year despite a collapse in global growth.“The US stock market has only been this highly valued twice before: during the Dot Com Bubble in the late 1990s and before the 1929 market crash signalling the beginning of the Great Depression,” said William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. He cited the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a closely watched metric of valuation.Bulls argue sky-high valuations reflect the bumper growth potential for the US economy once the worst of the pandemic passes. The IMF expects the US to grow by 5.1% this year. Earnings growth that should follow would justify today’s valuations.GameStop's stock has soared to unbelievable heights after Reddit forum users banded together to drive the price from $17.25 a share to over $325 a share. Photo: MediaPunch/IPX/APNot everyone is convinced. Veteran investor Jeremy Grantham, the cofounder of $64bn (£47bn) asset manager GMO, wrote at the start of last month: “The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble.”“I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000,” he wrote, decrying “extreme overvaluation” and “hysterically speculative investor behavior.” This was before r/WallStreetBets started pushing up prices of loss making, old school businesses like GameStop and AMC.Story continuesGameStop's wild ride. Chart: Yahoo FinanceSceptics like Grantham argue that cheap money from central banks and low interest rates have combined to inflated a huge bubble in the stock market. The problem has only been exacerbated by stimulus checks and furlough payments made to people stuck at home with little to spend money on.“For me, there is little doubt that huge central bank liquidity and government stimulus cheques in the hands of the underemployed/furloughed (through no fault of their own) retail investors will be a big part of this bubble story,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid wrote.GameStop has had a wild ride on Wall Street as the stock has been heavily traded - some say manipulated - by hedge fund managers short-selling shares while Redditors (registered users of the website Reddit) have utilized social media to artificially inflate the value of the stock. Photo: STRF/STAR MAX/IPx 2020/APResearch in the UK by Boscobel & Partners and FindOutNow estimated that 400,000 new investors joined the market in Britain last year, investing an estimated £20bn between them. Most were young men who were more likely to be furloughed than traditional investors. The newer crowd were also more likely to get their investment ideas from social media than more traditional sources.‘A warning’Some fear this wave of retail money could bring the stock market crashing down. Traditional investors, spooked by the anarchistic tendencies of the Redditors, may flee to safer corners like the bond market. Hedge funds hit by losses may be forced to liquidate profitable positions to cover their losses, feeding into the selling. And, when Redditors get bored and move on, many stocks will come crashing back to earth.“Retail exuberance is a warning,” Barclays’ head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau wrote in a note last week.If prices do start to turn, the mechanics of the rally mean it could unravel fast.Dow Jones slump and then recovery to record highs. Chart: Yahoo Finance“Derivative markets continue to mushroom and so does the use of margin debt – the latter once more stands near record-highs according to data from the New York Stock Exchange,” said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell.Margin debt is money borrowed from a broker to buy securities.

38,"French manufacturer, Citroen has finally unveiled their India-specific C5 Aircross SUV. While prices are yet to be announced, the brand’s entry into India will be marked by the SUV which is being offered in a single diesel engine but in two trim levels: Feel and Shine.Citroen is manufacturing the C5 Aircross locally at the company’s facility in Tamil Nadu with the eventual goal of reaching 90 percent localisation.In terms of design, we get to see Citroen’s unique language. While the final silhouette is that of a conventional SUV, there are geometric patterns littered throughout the car. The front sports a split headlamp unit, both connected with horizontal lines. While the lower lines form the grille, the upper lines converge in the middle into the brand’s logo. Off to the side, you have the Airbumps and at the rear, you get tail lamp squares filled with more squares and the trapezoidal exhausts below that.Powering the SUV is a 2-litre diesel engine that churns out 177 PS of power and 400 Nm of torque. This will be mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. Citroen has also added in their Progressive Hydraulic Cushion equipped suspension. This, the company claims will be able to filer out bumps and dips in the road allowing for a better cabin experience.On the inside, the geometric theme continues. Features include a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, keyless entry, dual-zone climate control, electrically adjustable driver’s seat, recline adjustable and slidable rear seats. The car also gets cruise control, powered and heated OVRMs, puddle lamps, auto headlamps and rain sensing wipers. The top variant, Shine on the other hand also gets LED headlamps, panoramic sunroof and a powered tail gate.Safety features are also top-of-the-line with blind spot monitoring (a segment-first feature), auto parking, reverse camera, tyre pressure monitoring, six airbags, driver attention monitor, hill-start assist, ABS, traction control and ISOFIX child seat mounts.The Citroen C5 Aircross is expected to launch sometime late February to early March and will go up against the likes of the Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour and the upcoming Volkswagen Tiguan. Expect a price near the Rs 30 lakh mark. The C5 Aircross is expected to be the first from Citroen with a new car lined for each year under the company’s C-Cubed programme."
39,"New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday welcomed the Union Budget for 2021-22, saying priority has been given to doubling farmers'' income by focusing on making available higher farm credit and post-harvest infrastructure in rural areas.""I welcome the budget.

You won’t agree with every selection from the TBEN list of the 100 Most Notable People on Blockchain.In fact, you’ll almost certainly disagree, vehemently, with many of the people we’ve included in this year’s list.You will rage at the inclusion of [insert comedy villain here] and the exclusion of, say, Charles Hoskinson. Especially if you are Charles Hoskinson.You’ll be bubbling over with the fact that Arthur Hayes is nowhere to be found. (We watched.) You’ll eat your own … words, because you tweeted once that John McAfee was a shoo-in.And despite your fury at the absence of delicious Charlie Lee, and the presence of [really, that guy?] we risk our Top 100 being the most comprehensive, most studied … and undoubtedly controversial selection in the blockchain industry.Our inclusion criteria this year recognizes that the TBEN Top 100 is not a crypto Who’s Who. No one is guaranteed a position based on their reputation. Instead, it refers to those whose choices over the past year have had a major impact on the industry, or on whom we expect to be particularly influential in 2021.His disrespect for the “ establishment ” of crypto, if such a thing can exist in an industry barely over a decade old, is reflected in the fact that there are an astonishing 75 new entrants on this year’s list.Even more surprising is the fact that not a single person from last year’s Top 10 kept their place at the top of this year’s list – and five of them left our Top 100 entirely.Our list, compiled with input from the entire TBEN editorial team, is not an endorsement of the people on it, nor a celebration of every achievement. We don’t like black hat hackers, but you can’t deny the impact they have had on our industry.And while it’s somewhat western-centric, it’s a deliberate choice since some of our regional editions have created their own lists. It should also be noted that we did not have quotas on diversity and inclusion, despite vigorous internal debate; the list is meritocratic, although we continue to be surprised and disappointed at the rate at which under-represented groups are entering the sector.That said, we’re encouraged that women now make up 24% of the top 50 – a significant increase from 10% in 2020.VISIT THE NOTABLE TBEN 100Our list includes ten people from each of our ten categories:FoundersIn preparing our list of founders, we must necessarily choose those whose ideas have started to materialize. These are people who have shown they have the patience and stamina to be successful, as well as the urge to innovate.InvestorsThe numbers on our investor roster often act as a bridge between blockchain and the mainstream financial world, and the more investors join the ranks of crypto, the closer the industry gets to widespread adoption.ChallengeThe Top DeFi Personalities List attempts to shine a light on this diverse roster of characters. In their – often surprisingly – different ways, each of them has made a contribution to the space in 2020, and many will continue to shape DeFi’s future.DefendersWe’re talking about rockstars, influencers, sports figures, OG tech assistants, converts from mainstream finance, and creatives of all stripes – even a captain – each with a shared desire to spread a common vision according to which distributed technology is the way we move humanity forward.Media, data and researchSome of the numbers we’ve highlighted in our Media, Data, and Research category are well known in the media, from crypto influencers and podcasters to cable TV hosts. Others run data analysis companies or aggregators that help us separate signal from noise. And there are a few personalities who work mostly behind the scenes, at the head of influential companies and research funds.The stepsThe people we have highlighted in our Markets category represent the most talented and resourceful analysts in the industry. Some have the uncanny ability to forecast macro market movements with a succinct single chart posted to Twitter, while others look at bitcoin’s on-chain activity to develop elaborate metrics aimed at institutional and long-term investors.ExchangeThose chosen for our Exchange category this year have responded to scaling challenges and emerging financial models in a variety of ways, including increasing server capacity, improving user experience, and deploying solutions like as the Bitcoin Lightning network, side chains and decentralized exchange protocols.AdoptionFor our Adoption category, we’ve highlighted the people in crypto who create and support products that go mainstream, as well as those who help us remember why we’re here in the first place.

46,"Diabetes during pregnancy may increase risk of heart diseaseNewMediaWire2021-02-01Research Highlights:An analysis of more than 1,000 women found that a history of gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) doubled the risk of heart artery calcification – a marker of increased risk for heart disease – many years after pregnancy, at the average age of 48, even if blood sugar returned to healthy levels.Health care systems should integrate women’s history of gestational diabetes into health records so that health care professionals do not wait until these women develop overt Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes to initiate prevention efforts.Embargoed until 4 a.m. CT/5 a.m. ET Monday, Feb. 1, 2021(NewMediaWire) - February 01, 2021 - DALLAS - Women with a history of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) are twice as likely by mid-life to develop calcium in heart arteries – a strong predictor of heart disease – even if healthy blood sugar levels were attained many years after pregnancy, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal Circulation.Gestational diabetes, which is high blood sugar levels (glucose intolerance) first recognized during pregnancy, affects approximately 9% of U.S. pregnancies and up to 20% worldwide. After pregnancy, women who had gestational diabetes are at higher risk of developing prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes, conditions that are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.Previous studies found a much higher risk of heart disease in women with a history of gestational diabetes who later developed Type 2 diabetes. However, it remained unclear whether heart disease risk among women with a history of gestational diabetes was lower for women who attained healthy glucose levels or who developed prediabetes in mid-life.In 2018, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Cholesterol Clinical Practice Guidelines specified that a history of gestational diabetes enhances women’s risk for artery build-up that leads to cardiovascular disease.Using data from the multicenter, 30-year prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adult (CARDIA) study, researchers investigated whether attaining healthy blood sugar levels after pregnancy would mitigate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease that is associated with a history of gestational diabetes.“CARDIA is the first study to assess heart disease risk in women with a history of gestational diabetes compared to those without gestational diabetes according their blood sugar levels many years later. Women with previous gestational diabetes had a twofold higher risk of coronary artery calcium if they maintained normal blood sugar levels, later developed prediabetes, or later were diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes many years after pregnancy compared to women without previous gestational diabetes who had normal blood sugar levels,” said Erica P. Gunderson, Ph.D., M.S., M.P.H., epidemiologist and senior research scientist in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Conditions Section at Kaiser Permanente’s Division of Research in Oakland, California.The CARDIA study enrolled more than 5,100 U.S. men and women who were aged 18-30 years at the beginning of the study in 1985. The new analysis includes approximately 1,100 women (49% Black women and 51% white women) without Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who subsequently gave birth at least once during the 25-year study period, which ended in 2011. Blood tests were performed from before to after pregnancies at five-year intervals to determine if women had normal blood sugar levels, intermediate elevations in blood sugar levels (prediabetes) or they had developed overt Type 2 diabetes. Heart scans were performed to measure coronary artery calcium, a strong predictor for heart disease, at exams 15, 20 and 25 years after the baseline, the first exam of the study.At the 25-year follow-up, the participants’ median age was 48 years old, and 12% of the women in the study had a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes. The prospective analysis found:Women with a history of gestational diabetes had a two-fold higher risk of coronary artery calcification whether they had healthy blood sugar levels, prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.Attaining healthy blood sugar levels after pregnancy did not decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in mid-life for women with previous gestational diabetes.Of women with previous gestational diabetes, 36% developed prediabetes and 26% developed Type 2 diabetes, compared to 35% and 9% of women with no history of gestational diabetes.25% of women with a history of gestational diabetes had some level of coronary artery calcium vs. 15% of women who never had gestational diabetes.“We were surprised to discover that women with a history of gestational diabetes are at a significantly greater risk of heart artery calcification, even if they maintain normal blood sugar levels after pregnancy,” Gunderson said.“Our"

48,"I’m not going to attract a straight line between the absence of a captain and the Dust-Up within the Tunnel between Tony DeAngelo and Alex Georgiev following Saturday evening’s additional time defeat to the Penguins that has rocked the franchise’s world and all however actually signaled the top of No. 77’s Broadway run.Mark Messier, Vic Hadfield, Barry Beck, Ron Greschner and Ryan Callahan might all have been carrying the sweater and the “C” on Saturday and they’d not have been capable of forestall the spontaneous combustion that occurred.But I do imagine that the Rangers, who appear to be coping with all kinds of points as they battle to seek out equilibrium out of the gate and get well the constructive 2019-20 vibes they apparently left behind within the Toronto bubble, do want a captain. I believe they do want an identifiable chief among the many management group.And at this juncture, there isn’t a higher man for the job than Chris Kreider, who in his tenth year with the group has emerged because the voice of the group.Prior to the season, the hierarchy that features president John Davidson, normal supervisor Jeff Gorton, head coach David Quinn and assistant GM Chris Drury, concluded that the group would profit from going with 4 alternates relatively than one captain. That implied that the group didn’t imagine that Kreider or presumptive main candidate Mika Zibanejad had been correct suits.With that in thoughts, a few weeks in the past I urged that Jacob Trouba can be a logical candidate to fill the publish beginning with subsequent season. That got here within the wake of the defenseman having been lauded by Quinn for his work within the room following the opening evening 4-0 debacle of a defeat to the Islanders.That was just a bit over two weeks in the past, even when it looks like a decade has handed since then. Good Ship Ranger has been springing leaks one after one other and is at risk of turning into the S.S. Minnow. Of course the coach goes to be in the end held accountable for the vessel’s destiny. But a powerful and distinguishable first mate goes to be wanted, too.And that might be Kreider, who has had blue blood operating by his veins since becoming a member of the Rangers initially of the 2012 playoffs simply a few days off the BC Chestnut Hill campus.There could also be administration considerations — there actually had been by No. 20’s early life — that Kreider internalizes an excessive amount of, worries an excessive amount of and that the captaincy would turn into a burden for him.But the expansion in Kreider’s stature has been regular even when consistency on the ice stays elusive. Saturday, visibly upset (and now we all know why there was purpose to be, past the result) on the Zoom name with the media, Kreider referred to as the group out for its woebegone efficiency in letting one other third-period lead get away.This wasn’t Kreider in his locker talking softly to a person journalist in an effort to get the message out. This was Kreider utilizing his platform to inform his teammates that it simply hasn’t been ok. And realizing Kreider, it’s all however sure that he despatched that message immediately earlier than blasting it into our on-line world, the place it is going to stay for all eternity or till the cloud is full.Chris Kreider NHLI by way of Getty ImagesIt is one factor to have 4 alternates in Zibanejad, Kreider, Trouba and Artemi Panarin, but when there may be one captain, then he turns into the singular particular person accountable for setting the bar. He turns into the participant accountable for confronting teammates if the hassle is just not ok.There have been all kinds of untamed tales circulating by the web the final two days concerning DeAngelo and his supposedly diseased relationship with Okay’Andre Miller. We have been instructed by quite a few people that there’s nothing to them and as an alternative innovations to go well with a story.The Rangers are anticipated to vigorously refute these tales throughout a press briefing earlier than Monday’s rematch on the Garden towards the Penguins. Teams throughout professional sports activities have a tendency to circle the wagons in cases equivalent to these, however it could behoove Davidson and the hierarchy to offer as a lot transparency as doable right here in an effort to counteract tales which have begun to achieve forex.(In addition, there are tales circulating that Kreider punched DeAngelo within the face after the preliminary imbroglio was damaged up by Miller, as The Post reported Monday morning. That is just not true, in response to a number of people with data of the state of affairs.)A younger group with a nonetheless young-in-NHL expertise coach is within the midst of a disaster of confidence. The goaltending has been shaky. The structure has been transient. Now this, prompting the enforced departure of one among final season’s most necessary property.The Rangers want a pacesetter. They want a captain.Calling K"

50,"Hopes of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation were dashed Monday as it was allocated only Rs 502 crore in the Union Budget for the fiscal 2021-22. With this, the civic body would be staring at another financial crisis this year. Interestingly, this amount has been allocated when the UT civic body has already passed a budget of Rs 1,627 crore.The municipal corporation was expecting a grant in aid of over Rs 1,000 crore from the UT Administration and they got nearly half of it. However, the grant in aid to be received this year is slightly more than what it got last year, which is Rs 425 core.Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO Skip AdThe municipal corporation’s own committed liabilities form around Rs 500 crore a year. Committed liabilities include expenses like electricity, water, salaries and pension of employees — expenditure which they cannot ignore. Remaining, if any, would be spent on development works of the city. Municipal corporation handles roads of the city, water supply, waste disposal, sewerage and other civic works.In the budget passed by it, for building and roads, the civic body has allocated around Rs 80 crore while Rs 55 crore has been allocated for augmentation of water supply. Moreover, Rs 23.60 crore has been allocated for ward development fund and Rs 47 crore has been kept for village development fund. Sewerage and civic works form around Rs 45 crore.Municipal corporation's own expected revenue is really less as compared to the budget it has prepared. From petrol pumps, the MC aims to earn Rs 130 crore, while from property tax it expects to earn Rs 50 crore. From water tariff and sewerage cess, civic body aims to earn around Rs 150 crore while it is expecting around 130 crore from other receipts.The finance and contract committee of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation in its meeting has already approved the budget estimates of Rs 443 crore under capital head and Rs 1,184 crore under the revenue head for the financial year 2021-22."
51,"Aside from prioritising investments, adopting an expansionary fiscal stance and pegging in a sharp increase in capital expenditure in FY22, the Budget has rightly taken several bold moves to strengthen the financial sector to ensure sustainable growth in the economy.As was widely expected, the Centre has finally laid down a roadmap for privatisation of public sector banks (two to start with). While this can improve credit growth, bring in better operational efficiencies, and address the growing recap issue, implementation will be critical.The government – the majority shareholder – has been injecting capital into PSBs year after year. But further recapitalisation has become challenging. Various estimates indicate that PSBs will require about ₹40,000-50,000 crore in FY22. Aside from the quantum of capital infusion, the other key issue lies in the government’s sizeable holdings, which impedes huge recapitalisation (over 90 per cent in few PSBs). Also, public sector bank boards are still not adequately professionalised, and the government still deciding on board appointments, has led to politicisation.Privatisation of some PSBs can help address these issues. But it will be important to implement such a bold move in a planned manner. After all, it will be critical for the entity to have strong boards before it is privatised, lest the government selling down its stake may not find many takers. PSBs have been trading at 0.4-0.5 times book value for the past few years. But even such low valuations, haven’t kindled investor interest.To push forth its wider set of objectives of state policy, the government can seek to retain full control of some large PSBs, and de-list them.Finally, a bad bankIn a bid to ease banks’ capital and spur lending, the Budget has finally proposed the setting up of a bad bank. But will this help restore the health of the banking sector?There are several issues that need attention while implementing such a proposal. For starters, assessing the amount of funding or capital that a bad bank requires will be critical as will be the mode of constant funding. In India, there are already 29 asset reconstruction companies. But ARCs have not been able to make a meaningful impact owing to multiple headwinds. One critical issue has been capital. ARC is a capital intensive business. While there are 29 ARCs, the top three ARCs constitute over 70 per cent of the industry. Owing to judicial delays in the recovery process, drawing investors has been difficult.Also, steady recapitalisation of originating banks (selling bad loans to the bad bank) will also be imperative, as asset transfer is likely to occur at a price below the book value. How will the government raise resources to meet the overall funding requirement?The next critical issue to be addressed will be pricing. Arriving at a consensus on pricing has been a key issue with banks and ARCs, more so because of the lack of a distressed asset market in India. In case of a bad bank a transparent and robust pricing mechanism will be all the more critical. Also, the bad bank will need institutional independence, ring-fencing it from political intervention.Addressing all these issues will be critical for the bad bank to serve its intended purpose.Insurance is an important route through which the Centre can raise stable long-term money. Hence, increasing the FDI limit in insurance to 74 per cent from 49 per cent can help bring in more capital into the sector. However, will raising the FDI limit alone draw foreign investors into the sector? Not necessarily, if past trends are any indication.Also, the rationalisation of taxation of ULIPs, could impact some players which have a heavy ULIP portfolio and a higher ticket size.The government had increased the FDI limit in insurance in 2015 to 49 per cent from 26 per cent. But five years after the limit was raised, only 8 life insurance players out of 23 private players, and 4 out of the 21 private general insurers have foreign promoter holdings of 49 per cent. Many insurance players still have foreign holdings of 26 per cent or even lower, according to data available for September 2020. Indian promoters still hold 100 per cent stake in companies such as Exide Life, Kotak Mahindra Life and Reliance General.But given the broader picture across both life and general insurance players, it appears that raising the FDI limit alone may not assure easy access to capital. Also, while the mandate that the majority of directors on the board should be resident Indians is welcome, whether there will be any cap on voting rights of foreign shareholders needs to be seen.In what could hurt the top line growth of few life insurance players, the Budget has sought to remove the tax exemption currently available on maturity proceeds of ULIPs (above annual premium of ₹2.5 lakh). This can hurt the growth of few life insurance players that have a heavy ULIP portfolio. Of the listed players, ICICI Pru Life and SBI Life have a relatively h"

56,"More firms are set to learn from a lighter compliance burden because the finance minister has proposed to revise the definition of a small firm below India’s company legal guidelines.Also, corporations will discover it simpler to resolve their debt, and the mergers and acquisitions area will seemingly see elevated exercise, as Nirmala Sitharaman stated the federal government would introduce various strategies of debt decision together with a particular framework for micro, small and medium enterprises, together with measures to strengthen the National Company Law Tribunals.While the minister didn’t present particulars of the choice strategies, the company affairs ministry had final month proposed a framework for pre-packaged insolvency decision, which is predicted to fast-track the method by out-of-court negotiations that may require a courtroom approval solely on the finish.As per the brand new definition, an organisation with a paid-up capital of as much as Rs 2 crore and turnover of as much as Rs 20 crore will qualify as a small firm, versus the present thresholds of Rs 50 lakh and Rs 10 crore. This change is predicted to learn some 200,000 firms.With a concentrate on ease of doing enterprise, the federal government would take up decriminalisation of compoundable offences below the Limited Liability Partnership Act, Sitharaman stated. It has already completed this for the Companies Act.The minister additionally introduced adjustments to the principles governing one-person firms (OPCs).Under the prevailing guidelines, such firms with a paid-up capital of over Rs 50 lakh or turnover exceeding Rs 2 crore should convert to a standard firm. The finances has proposed to put off these limits altogether, together with eradicating the restriction on non-resident Indians from incorporating such firms, a transfer which Sitharaman stated was anticipated to learn startups.While this may occasionally allow one-person firms to scale up and luxuriate in easier statutory compliances, the adjustments are unlikely to learn startups a lot, stated Ankit Singhi, accomplice at Corporate Professionals. “Startups need to raise funds by increasing the number of board members but OPCs cannot have more than one person on the board,” Singhi stated.According to Nischal Arora, accomplice at Nangia & Co, the transfer will encourage small unorganised sector gamers to conduct their companies by a legally arrange entity.The proposed adjustments to OPCs and the definition of small firms would require adjustments solely to firm guidelines and never an modification to the legislation, Singhi stated.“The Companies Act prescribes a maximum paid up capital threshold of Rs 10 crore and a maximum turnover threshold of Rs 100 crore for small companies. The changed definition falls within this range and will not require changes to the law,” he stated."

Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LPSummer trips across the pond were a post-war tradition, with hordes of Americans making the annual pilgrimage to Europe. Britain, a seven-hour flight from the East Coast, was often the first (or only) stopover.The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated transatlantic travel in 2020 with quarantines, travel restrictions and airline closures, as well as, let’s face it, customer disgust for the plane. But JetBlue is announcing an upcoming service from the United States to London, which could challenge the fun factor. A key part of JetBlue’s plan is to bring its popular TBEN offering to transatlantic flights, making premium travel “less stuffy and more affordable,” according to Joanna Geraghty, president and chief operating officer of JetBlue.Ms Geraghty told us, “London is the biggest underserved market outside of New York and Boston – we think we can disrupt with a much better product.” A key part of this product offering is their premium seat, which JetBlue calls the TBEN experience. The Boston Globe in 2018 called the US version of TBEN the airline’s business-class version with “first-class amenities at a bargain price of $ 599.”(Full disclosure: I own shares in Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and JetBlue.)JetBlue says service to London (airport TBD) from New York or Boston will begin in the third quarter, between July 1 and September 30. JetBlue will not be more specific on when the service begins, when tickets go on sale, or how they will be priced.JetBlue’s new Airbus A321LR, a long-range single-aisle jet, will operate transatlantic flights. Two classes of service will be offered, the luxurious TBEN Experience and JetBlue’s Core seats, or coach class. JetBlue says TBEN seats are suites. The A321LR will feature 24 private suites with a sliding door for each guest and a custom designed seat cushion by Tuft & Needle.JetBlue is the first carrier to equip its aircraft with the Thompson Aero VantageSolo seat, which includes a 17-inch seat screen, power in the seat and plenty of storage. As Thompson says, “From a seat pitch of just 33 inches, the VantageSolo offers a fully horizontal flat bed with direct aisle access for each seat. TBEN seats “Are all very private and self-contained, and each suite has a window,” says Jayne O’Brien, Head of Brand and Loyalty at JetBlue.Aerial view of JetBlue TBEN Suite, showing a side table, gust seat, and 22 inch TV screen. … [+] be a booking option on A321LR flights to London in 2021. © 2017 Chad SlatteryIf that’s not enough luxury or privacy, passengers can book a TBEN Studio. Each plane will have two TBEN studios in the front row, a feat. JetBlue boasts that TBEN Studio has the largest flatbed of any US carrier, plus a 22-inch reclining back screen and a side table with a guest seat. O’Brien adds, “You can even invite a guest to share a table.”Premium reclining seats have been a crucial source of revenue for airlines. Geraghty says, “A lot of customers want this type of product but don’t want to pay $ 5,000 for their seat at the published rates. We impose a level of pricing discipline; TBEN was as low as $ 499 when we launched transcontinental service in 2014. ”Does Geraghty feel some trepidation due to the fluctuations in the stock market and the continuing pandemic? Geraghty said, “We don’t. There will be light at the end of the tunnel with the increasing use of vaccines. This has been a painful year, but things are opening up and this service is an exciting opportunity for JetBlue. “Could the service be postponed due to COVID-19 issues, such as quarantines, test questions, or vaccine availability? “We don’t know what we don’t know about travel restrictions or international testing,” Geraghty says, “we hope there will be a more cohesive framework.”Geraghty describes the aircraft to be used, the new Airbus A321LR, as “very flexible”. The single-aisle jet offers a range of 4,000 miles while being economical to operate. Equally important, with around 180 seats, it should be easy to fill with passengers, especially compared to large jets like the 500-seat Airbus A380 or the popular 248-seat Boeing 787 Dreamliner.Norwegian Airlines, which recently withdrew from US service due to financial problems, operated 37 Dreamliners. Could the departure of Norwegian, which as recently as 2020 was the largest foreign carrier operating outside the New York area, carrying over 2 million passengers, help JetBlue’s European bid?Geraghty declined to comment on the Norwegian. Instead, she cited JetBue’s significant presence on the East Coast, “a wonderful premium product and a solid core (coach) product, and partnerships with other airlines.”And while Geraghty is confident the new service will be successful, she says as she tries out t"

The iShares Silver Trust ETF jumped 9.6% in premarket trading as silver broke above $30 an ounce for the first time since 2013 with an army of retail traders storming into the metal after betting billions of dollars on stocks last week.Silver miners Hecla Mining Co, Coeur Mining Inc and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp surged between 14% and 32%. ""It's just a relief rally after the sharp decline on Friday,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.AdvertisementWall Street's main indexes last week logged their steepest weekly fall since October, as investors digested efficacy data from Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine trial results, while a slugfest between Wall Street hedge funds and retail investors added to the volatility. The CBOE volatility index eased on Monday from three-month highs that were fueled by a surge in shares of GameStop Corp, AMC Entertainment Holdings and others that burnt hedge funds who had bet against the companies. GameStop was down about 1%, while AMC jumped another 25%.The wild swings in the so-called ""meme"" stocks dominated the news on Wall Street last week, even as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and other corporate heavyweights reported quarterly results. ""The sentiment right now is precarious. The market has already discounted a good earnings season and rebound in economic growth based on the vaccination,"" Cardillo said.Of the 184 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings, 84.2% have topped analyst expectations, well above the 75.5% beat rate for the past four quarters, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday. Focus now turns towards quarterly earnings from Amazon.com Inc and Google-owner Alphabet Inc on Tuesday to wrap up results from the so-called FAANG group.Meanwhile, market participants also monitored stimulus talks.

59,"When we spend so much of our time online, we’re bound to learn something while clicking and scrolling. Discover something new with Mashable’s series I learned it on the internet.Filed away in my vast catalogue of Deep Dark Fears, subfolder Internet-Related, is the dread of discovering myself as the antagonist in an advice column letter.During one especially rough period in a years-ago job, I had to stop reading Alison Green’s excellent work advice column Ask A Manager. I was irrationally anxious that I’d come across the untenable situation I was in, neatly recounted so that Green could rule against me. The mere sight of a “34F” (my current age and gender, not my bra size) in a Reddit advice post often gives me a momentary flash of alarm before I read on and confirm that no, I am probably not the writer’s soon-to-be sister-in-law who’s demanding that her pet ferrets replace the groom’s nephew as ring-bearer.I’ve been an online advice addict for years. Procrastinating on prepaid internet in my university library in the mid-00s, I trawled through years of archived Dear Prudence and Since You Asked columns on Slate and Salon, respectively, then Savage Love and Heather Havrilesky’s Dear Rabbit. I read Havrilesky on The Awl as Ask Polly and then followed various members of the Awl/Hairpin/Toast Extended Content Universe to later advice-dispensaries at bigger sites. (I never went through a big Dear Sugar phase, somehow.) And now, of course, there's a glorious array of internet sages, from ¡Hola Papi! to the crowdsourced, democratized blob of solicited advice in the queasily addictive annals of advice subreddits, from r/AITA to r/relationships.I have relished the gossipy thrills of reading about people’s awful mothers-in-law (so many!), and gulped down tough and tender counsel for more existential dilemmas as I wrestled with my own. I studied the carefully worded scripts some agony aunts and uncles offered for delicate situations — as a neurodivergent person who's not always great with social cues and emotional perspective, I found these perspectives were useful ways to build empathy and a better picture of what's ""right"" in a range of situations. And a few years ago, I wept over hundreds of almost identical posts and letters from people wondering if they were “allowed” to break up with a good person whom they loved in order to give them both a better chance at happiness. (They are, and so was I.)It’s addictive, and it’s certainly worth remembering that, as Slate’s current Dear Prudence writer Daniel Lavery cautions me, “advice columns are about entertainment, not just moral instruction.” But as the overflowing inboxes of any prominent advice columnist prove, there’s never any shortage of people clamouring for both.“People write to advice columns for all kinds of reasons but probably a big overarching reason is the desire to narrativize a problem they're having,” explains Emily Gould, a novelist and a recent-ish addition to Slate’s parenting advice column Care And Feeding . “‘Asking for advice’ is a form. Within that form, you can tell a story.”Jennifer Peepas, aka advice blogger Captain Awkward , started saving advice columns while she was in grad school studying film because they ""were great source material for screenplays and other fiction.""“You've got characters, you've got conflict, you've got a distinct point of view in terms of who is asking the question and how reliable a narrator they are,"" she says.I wonder when we will collectively admit that the dominant short fiction forms of the 2020s are r/AITA posts and online advice column letters — Emily Gould (@EmilyGould) September 16, 2020Even when we’re not actively wrestling with a specific thorny problem of our own, it’s natural to look for ourselves in other people’s stories, to seek out the characters we identify with and pick a side, because stories are — say it with me — how we help make sense of ourselves and others.But whether or not we are literally the nightmare coworker or clueless bridesmaid, what do we actually get out of devouring these dilemmas? Can they actually teach us, as Havrilesky’s collection of advice letters and answers promises, how to be a person in the world ?It still counts as reaching outSlate sex advice columnist Stoya, who began doling out expertise “on Tumblr in the 2010s” armed with her experience in adult entertainment, says simply that advice columns are “a great way to learn.”“I came of age reading Dan Savage,” she tells me in an email. “His column ran in a local Philadelphia weekly paper, and it tackled so much of the reality of communicating about sex, which I wasn't able to find books covering at the time. He's obviously critiqueable, but I learned a lot from him about moving on when something isn't a match, which I think has served me well and comes up in my own work for Slate.”And there’s a more fundamental benefit to being in the audience for these shared problems: They connect you to the people sharing them. Yes, you"
60,"Silver broke above US $ 30 an ounce for the first time since 2013 on Monday as an army of retail traders broke into the metal after betting billions of dollars in stocks last week.Organized in online forums and traded with free brokers such as Robinhood, small investors led a 1,600% rally in the shares of video game retailer GameStop, recovering the assets that the big fund managers had bet against.The phenomenon spilled over into silver late last week.Spot silver jumped more than 11 percent in London to $ 30.03 an ounce and was on track for its biggest one-day rise since 2008, taking gains to around 19 percent since Wednesday latest.The jump sparked a rally in silver mining stocks from Sydney to London.The silver action, following thousands of Reddit posts and hundreds of YouTube videos, suggests that a physical price hike could hurt large investors with bearish bets, also marks a foray into a much larger market and more liquid than individual stocks.ALSO READ How 3 Canadians Fight Anti-Black Racism in Education | TBEN News On Twitter, #silversqueeze was all the rage as investors turned to money, but some members of the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit insist it’s not their latest strategy. (Dado Ruvic / Reuters)“I would look at the money rally the same way as the GameStop saga – from a market stability standpoint, at this point it’s not an immediate concern, but if we see any sharp moves, we could see some deleveraging in the markets, ”said Antoine Bouvet, pricing strategist at ING.“This reduction in risk through deleveraging could potentially stimulate demand for bonds if it results in excessive volatility.”In the first signs of deleveraging, Goldman Sachs said the amount of position hedging last week by US hedge funds, buying and selling, was the highest since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.However, their stock market exposure to equities remains close to record levels, the investment bank warned.Rise of new trading platformsThe rush for money and GameStop-style stocks has tested the limits of new trading platforms and processing sites, frustrating retail traders who are unable to feed their hunger to buy and sell. sell more frequently.The feverish buying of silver has run into a problem, with large US broker Apmex warning of processing delays as it secures more bullion. The online exchange Money Metals has suspended trading until mid-morning Monday.The volume of trading in small miner stocks in Australia was unprecedented, and jumps in some exploration companies, which do not actually produce money, have exceeded 90 percent.Similar hiccups were seen in stocks over the past week. GameStop, AMC, and a few other volatile stocks have seen temporary buying restrictions in trading apps like Robinhood as frenzied buying has led trading apps to put on the brakes.“The Reddit crowd has turned to a bigger whale in trying to catalyze something with short squeeze in the silver market,” said Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG Markets brokerage in Melbourne.“It’s their big and daring Moby Dick moment.”The stock of video game retailer GameStop saw huge increases last week as a group of retail investors rallied to buy it. (Carlo Allegri / Reuters)Silver the last ‘short squeeze’The popularity of dabbling in the stock markets has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as volatility, stimulus checks and lockdowns have resulted in account openings and investments.The craze peaked last week when the GameStop stacking resulted in a ‘short squeeze,’ transforming price gains stratospheric as hedge funds with stock bets desperately bought it off at stocks. high prices to close their positions.Now it’s the turn of the money and, once again, the scale of the purchases surprises professionals.Online discussions turned to silver late last week, as Reddit posts suggested that higher prices could hurt banks with large short positions, and that buying traded silver funds easily accessible stock exchanges could quickly increase the value of the metal.Retail traders poured a record C $ 39.1 million into Australian ETF Securities’ Physical Silver fund in the afternoon. A silver ETF in Japan jumped 11 percent.All eyes are on possible gains later today in iShares’s US-listed $ 16.5 billion Silver Trust ETF, which rose 5.6% last week.“We see little chance of a tightening in the silver market,” Commerzbank’s Eugen Weinberg said. “After all, the market is not only large and difficult to manipulate; unlike stocks, there is no excessive short selling with money.”So far, Redditors continue. Many of the renegade traders are paper millionaires and their hedge fund opponents are healing their wounds. Melvin Capital, which bet against GameStop, lost 53% of its portfolio in January.The Robinhood trading app has exploded in popularity this year by offering free trading, fueling a boom in retail investor activity.

68,"The unending desire to provide quality care at an affordable cost and develop a model that benefits all the stakeholders in the healthcare spectrum – patient, provider, payer, and pharma – has posed a big challenge. The industry is eagerly looking for disruptive ideas to offer relief from the vicious operating cycle, the inability to provide desired care and, mounting costs. With that in mind and the switch to retail-ization for the healthcare industry, we would like to present the concept of Just in Time (healthcare) Contracts (JITC). In a nutshell, JITC is a proposed facility to establish a contractual obligation, i.e., healthcare insurance contracts between payers and providers for a given case and ascertained period.With the evolution of technologies such as blockchain, AI, and advanced analytics and integration standards like FHIR, this will become the norm in the coming years. JITC will empower payers to have a greater understanding of the risks to be covered, providers to have greater clarity on reimbursements, and patients to have better knowledge of their obligations.Forging a plan: JITC ImplementationThe proposed model will help providers avoid the need to choose between avoiding financial risks and providing care. JITC can help deliver care with minimized risks by using advanced technologies. Key determinants of the contract will include:Deployment of blockchain-based consortiums that leverage smart contracts.Use of patient data in the contracts for establishing the care risks including financial risks.Putting out the risk parameters, along with the current care needs, to payers and providers.A contract will be drafted with the nearest provider or provider of choice and with payer(s) willing to underwrite the care risk at an affordable cost for the patient.The contract will continue to serve as the vehicle till the complete financial and care transactions between all the parties are settled.Ideally, with this setup, the provider should be paid for the service under the contract within two to three days, bringing down the AR period. Among many opportunities for payers, JITC will ensure retail-ization of health insurance and create a market for product innovation. It will also break the shackles of network rigidity and complex actuarial models to sculpt networks. Instead, these efforts will be directed towards providing better care to patients. JITC will also provide an opportunity to directly deal with individual members rather than depending on an institutional average to understand the care risk, which is the paradigm all the payers strive towards.Data-driven risk assessment strategiesWe believe JITC will become a reality only when all the stakeholders of the healthcare continuum can accurately understand the relevant risk of coverage sought under the contract. For this, the payers may assess the risk based on numerous factors including but not limited to:Individual’s personal, social, and clinical profileIndividual’s preferred provider profileKnowledge on the medical condition under coverageKnowledge on treatment outcomes from the specific provider for the specific medical conditionSimilarly, providers may assess the risk based on:Individual’s profileOutcomes of previous treatmentReimbursement experience with specific payersUndoubtedly, data – about individuals, conditions, providers, outcomes, etc. – is crucial for stakeholders to equip themselves with risk assessment capabilities. Wealth of data, effective organization of data, and advanced data analytics employing machine learning techniques will form the backbone of JITC. Here, data analytics will help in risk evaluation, contract pricing, best provider identification, exclusion assessment, and even enable contextualized, value-added services beyond JITC. For example, if the contract sought involves any hospitalization for post-operative/post-discharge care, individuals can be offered suggestions to connect with skilled nurses, laboratories, or caregivers that are already plugged onto the consortium network.The futureWe believe, just like Uber transformed transportation and Airbnb changed hospitality, JITC has the potential to drive a considerable shift within the healthcare segment. Uber Eats, that has created last-mile integration for many small restaurants that required logistics to reach end customers, is a good example. Currently, we are evaluating a single dimension of JITC, however we believe, it can drive wide change in the existing models of healthcare delivery.Additionally, JITC has the potential to ensure right care for the right price at the right time and also open new avenues for care. The contract will make room for a variety of providers not backed by a large organizational umbrella to provide care, thus driving the industry into a disruptive transformation fueled by evolving digital technologies. In our opinion, sooner or later, JITC will be embraced as the norm for providing care."
69,"In a significant move to augment funds for the infrastructure and real estate sectors, the government on Monday proposed permitting foreign portfolio investors an entry into debt financing of emerging investment vehicles - REITs and InvITs In the Union Budget for 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also proposed exempt taxes on dividends on REITs and InvITs, which will make such investment vehicles attractive and lucrative for investors.REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) are relatively new investment instruments in the Indian context but are popular in global markets.While a REIT comprises a portfolio of commercial real assets, a major portion of which are already leased out, InvIT comprises a portfolio of infrastructure assets such as highways and power transmission assets.""Debt financing of InVITs and REITs by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) will be enabled by making suitable amendments in the relevant legislations,"" the minister said.This will further ease access of finance to InvITs and REITs, thus augmenting funds for infrastructure and real estate sectors, she added.""The proposal of providing FPIs an entry into debt financing of REITs and InvITs will open up a large source of fresh funding for the infrastructure and real estate sectors. This will also open up a new avenue for FPIs to invest in a growing market like India,"" Manoj Purohit, Partner and Leader - Financial Services Tax at BDO India said.In the context of the real estate sector, budget announcements relating to monetisation of infrastructure and real estate assets will help increase private sector participation and also assist government in enhancing fund flow for development of critical infrastructure assets, Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director of Knight Frank India said.The relaxation on tax compliance for REIT investors will further improve the marketability of such products considering we are likely to witness new REITs this year, he added.In order to provide ease of compliance, the finance minister has proposed to make dividend payments to REIT and InvIT exempt from Tax Deducted at Source ( TDS ).Further, as the amount of dividend income cannot be estimated correctly by the shareholders for paying advance tax, the minister proposed to provide that advance tax liability on dividend income would arise only after the declaration or payment of dividend.Also, for FPIs, it has been proposed to enable deduction of tax on dividend income at lower treaty rate.V Balasubramaniam, MD and CEO, India INX welcomed the budget announcement on allowing debt financing of REITs and InvITs by FPIs and is well poised to providing listing and trading of these products on the exchange with considerable ease of business and quicker time to market for issuers and tax efficient trading for foreign investors across time zones with 22 hours non-stop trading.""Further, the FM's announcement to exempt taxes on dividends on REITs and InvITs will make them attractive and lucrative for investor,"" he said.Sandeep Upadhyay, MD (Infrastructure Advisory) atsaid TDS exemption on dividend payments to InvITs and REITS will certainly entice more sovereign wealth funds to invest into the sector.The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) first issued the guidelines for REITs and InvITs in 2014, and revised them in 2016 and 2017.Ever since Sebi introduced InvITs, markets witnessed the listing of two public InvITs - IRB InvIT Fund and India Grid Trust. Some InvITs - IndInfravit Trust, India Infrastructure Trust, Oriental InfraTrust and Tower Infrastructure - were privately placed.Last week, Power Grid Corporation of India filed preliminary papers with Sebi to float infrastructure investment trust through which it seeks to raise over Rs 5,000 crore.On the other hand, Embassy Office Parks REIT and Mindspace REIT are the only two listed REITs while Brookfield India REIT would launch its initial public offer on February 3."
70,"UK marks first COVID vaccine milestone with care home protectionThe UK government on Monday said it has hit a crucial milestone” in its COVID-19 vaccination program, with figures indicating that residents at every eligible care home with older residents across England now administered a life-saving jab.The National Health Service (NHS) said nurses, general practitioners (GPs) and other NHS staff have offered the life-saving jab to people living at more than 10,000 care homes with older residents, with only a small remainder have had their visits deferred by local directors of public health for safety reasons during a local outbreak. Those homes will be visited and jabbed as soon as NHS staff are allowed to do so.Today marks a crucial milestone in our ongoing race to vaccinate the most vulnerable against this deadly disease. We said we would prioritise and protect care home residents, and that is exactly what we have done, said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.There will be difficult moments to come, and the number of cases and people in hospital remains dangerously high. But vaccines are our route out of the pandemic, and having protected 8.9 million people with a first dose so far, our rollout programme will only accelerate from here on, he said.Ian Turner, Executive Chair of the Registered Nursing Home Association, quoted Mahatma Gandhi in reference to the major rollout drive to protect the elderly from the deadly virus.As Mahatma Gandhi said the true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable’, and the pandemic has brought that quotation to the fore,” he said.The NHS said that vaccination staff are now returning to homes that have been covered to jab any resident who was unable to have it during the previous visit because they had recently had COVID-19 or for other clinical reasons.It has been a privilege to vaccinate some of the most vulnerable people and the wonderful people who look after them. Many have had little contact with the outside world throughout the pandemic and so it has been truly humbling for all, giving them hope and importantly protection against the disease, said Dr Nikki Kanani, a practising GP and NHS England’s primary care director.“I would urge anyone who is offered the vaccine to come forward,” she said.The UK’s Joint Committee of Vaccinations and Immunisations (JCVI), which set the priority groups for the COVID-19 vaccines, made older adult care home residents and their staff high priority groups due to being at particular risk from COVID-19 because of their age and frailty.NHS England offered GPs up to GBP 30 extra to vaccinate care home residents in January to cover the increased time and logistics required in bringing the vaccine to care homes.Our priority has been to protect care home residents throughout this pandemic, and I’m delighted we have reached this monumental milestone to protect the most at risk, said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.We cannot be complacent, and it is absolutely imperative everyone continues to play their part by staying home and protecting the NHS while the rollout continues, he warned.According to the NHS, which is conducting the biggest programme of its kind in its history, vaccinations are now being administered at more than 250 hospitals, over 1,000 GP-led services, 117 high street pharmacies and 47 large-scale vaccination centres across the country with more coming online over the coming days and weeks.With over 2 million more people vaccinated in communities across England this past week, the NHS’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign is off to a flying start with nearly nine out of ten people aged 80 and above, and over three quarters of people aged 75 and over, now having had their first jab,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive.UK Care Minister Helen Whately said the government is working “on what we can do to try and enable visiting to restart” in care homes to enable families to be reunited.The NHS is currently administering the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs, with three other jabs by Moderna, Novavax and Janssen also expected to come into the system in the coming months. For care homes, it has largely been the Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs being delivered due to the logistics of easier mobility and storage requirements.The UK government has set a target to vaccinate care home residents and carers, people over 70 and frontline care workers by February 15.Meanwhile, a further 587 virus-related deaths were reported on Sunday, which takes the UK’s COVID-19 death toll to 106,158 as the country remains under a strict ‘stay-at-home’ lockdown to keep control over a very high infection rate."

The new iPhone unlock feature appeared with the first developer beta version of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4, that Apple started rolling out earlier this week. The public beta versions of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4 are not yet out though the company may roll out soon. The new unlock feature is similar to Apple's 'unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch.'According to 9to5Mac, developers need to go to Settings on the iPhone to enable the 'Unlock with Apple Watch' feature. Users then need to search Face ID & Passwords > Enable Unlock with Apple Watch. The report adds that for the feature to work, users must ensure that Face ID detects masks, Apple Watch is nearby the iPhone model, the smartwatch in on your wrist, and Apple Watch has a passcode enabled. Additionally, users will receive haptic feedback on the Apple Watch once the iPhone is unlocked.#iOS14.5 beta 1, iPhone unlock process with #AppleWatch wearing a facemask Easy and super smooth! pic.twitter.com/ADkE0dVS0I — Luca Ansevini (@Anse1987) February 1, 2021As expected, the feature would be highly useful amid the COVID-19 pandemic as people are advised to wear a mask whenever they are outdoors. However, this feature will only be limited to iPhone X and above as the newer iPhone flagships only carry the Face ID as biometric authentication to scan for facial features to unlock the device. Alongside the new unlocking system, the iOS 14.5 developer beta brings support for Xbox Series S/ X and PlayStation 5 controllers.

151,"Let me admit, this was supposed to be a first impression. But, the PlayStation 5 is so addictive that I spent most of my free time over the past week glued to the screen, playing enough games to come up with the review. It took Sony a while to bring the PlayStation 5 to India and now that it's here, this beast of a console is likely to rule for the next few years. It was in 2018 when we first started hearing about PS5, Sony confirmed the launch following year and the first glimpse was shown in early 2020.By the end of that year, Sony PS5 had launched in most markets, except India. The timing couldn't have been better we were in the middle of the pandemic, gaming was on a rise, people wanted more avenues to kill time and there was a need for more advanced gaming equipment. Sadly, the pandemic was for everyone. So, there was a shortage of supply and whatever was available, was lifted by the scalpers.In India, the company faced different issues first with the trademark, then with the disrupted supply chains. The gaming enthusiasts got some relief on January 1 when Sony finally announced the India launch for February 2. As expected, the limited stock was sold out within minutes when the pre-orders began on January 12, 2021.Despite Microsoft's Xbox series arriving earlier, there is clearly high demand for Sony's new-gen console. The temptation is so high that regular gamers have been selling hardware or saving for months so that they can spend Rs 50,000 on the PlayStation (disc variant). But, should you? Is it a genuine upgrade? What are the changes or improvements? Let's look at all that in detail in our Sony PlayStation 5 review.PlayStation 5 review: Most Futuristic DesignThe Sony PlayStation 5 flaunts the most futuristic design on a gadget I have reviewed in long time. Usually, people buy gadgets and blend them with their living room. This one, will force you to make changes to the overall setting. The initial reveal and images put out by gamers around the world gave an idea that the PlayStation 5 is big. But, I wasn't expecting it to be this huge and thick. The disc edition, which we have for the review, is 390mm x 104mm x 260mm (width x height x depth) in size.© Provided by India TodayThis time you have the option to place the console both horizontally and vertically. When placed vertically, the PS5 looks like a gadget straight out of Star Trek, especially with that cool PlayStation logo on one corner. Imagine if Captain James Kirk actually had this thing on the USS Enterprise! His journey to explore new worlds would have ended with running around and completing missions within games.Now, there are two things that you need to keep in mind when deciding the orientation of the device. First if placed vertically, there is a chance that you might end up covering a part of the television screen with the console, unless it is kept on the sides or on a table of comparatively lower height. In either case, the length of the HDMI cable can play the deciding role.© Provided by India TodaySecond the process to switch between the two orientations is not seamless and requires some work. The PlayStation comes with a base stand that needs to be fixed under the machine in both cases. So, every time you plan to change the orientation, you will have to remove the screw from the stand, change its position, put the screw back and tighten it to make sure that the console doesn't wobble.The entire process can be tiresome and requires some delicacy to avoid damage. This isn't easy to perform when you're handling a machine that weighs close to 4.5 kgs. Needless to say, the PlayStation 5 looks more glamorous when kept vertically. It features two LED strips one on each side which makes the console really stylish.© Provided by India TodaySony has also switched to a 'V' shaped front from a more squarish PS4. I am not sure if it was a conscious decision to remind that this is the fifth-generation console or a mere coincidence but is surely a welcome move. The device comes with a sandwich-like design where the glossy-central part in black is covered by white plates with matte finish on either side.White colour usually has the tendency of losing the charm earlier than most other options. In the six days, I have had this console at home, it seems capable of keeping dust away, but we will get a better idea with time.PlayStation 5 review: Inside the BoxFor now, the box remains pretty basic. It comes with the console, one DualSense Controller, a USB-A to type-C cable, power cable, manual, HDMI 2.1 cable, user manual and the base stand. The screw to fix the base stand is housed at the bottom of the stand itself. There are no games with the retail unit as of now. The Astro Playroom comes pre-installed, but you can expect Sony to launch bundles in future.PlayStation 5 review: Advanced connectivity optionsThe PlayStation 5 comes with more and advanced connectivity options including USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports that Sony classify as a Superspeed USB with"

154,"When Google announced the launch of its gaming streaming platform Stadia in 2019, CEO Sundar Pichai pitched it as a service that would revolutionise the way people play games.The idea was that Stadia would let gamers play top-tier without needing to buy and own expensive computers or dedicated gaming consoles. Instead, all games would run on cloud servers in Google’s data centres, and a video feed of the game would be broadcast to the user’s device of choice — such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, or smart TV.While it plans to still deliver on that, Google will do it without its in-house Stadia Games and Entertainment (SG&E) development team, which it announced on late Monday would be no more.SUPPORT US | TFY SPONSORED ARTICLES | BEST OFFERS“Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Google Stadia VP and general manager Phil Harrison announced in a blog post.In shutting SG&E, it has seen the departure of VP Jade Raymond, as well as the rest of the team which Harrison said will be “moving on to new roles”.Going forward, Harrison said Google will focus on working with external game developers and publishers to bring their games directly to players via its cloud streaming platform.“We see an important opportunity to work with partners seeking a gaming solution all built on Stadia’s advanced technical infrastructure and platform tools. We believe this is the best path to building Stadia into a long-term, sustainable business that helps grow the industry,” he said.Last month, Google’s parent company Alphabet announced it would be winding down its internet balloon firm Loon, pointing out that the company’s demise was due to a lack of willing partners and an inability to build a sustainable business model.The company was best known for using giant high-altitude balloons and network partnership with global telcos to beam internet to remote parts of the world.The former Google X project was spun out as an independent company of Alphabet in 2018 alongside Wing, Alphabet’s drone business.Related CoverageNvidia GeForce Now cloud gaming service becomes generally availableThree years after it was announced at CES 2017, GeForce Now is out of beta.Google Stadia gaming platform introduces bandwidth controls in light of coronavirusGoogle says the restrictions are necessary to responsibly manage traffic demands.Google snaps up Typhoon Studios to work on Stadia game developmentThe move signals Google’s desire to secure more in-house talent for game content creation.Streaming retro games brings out all of the bad points of Google Stadia, and none of the goodAntstream wants to emulate retro games in the cloud using streaming video like Google Stadia, though emulation is practically the best use case for edge computing.By ZDNet Source Link"

156,"OnePlus success in the smartphone market has led to the diversification of its products, meaning from just being a smartphone-centric company now it has moved into producing other gadgets as well. In recent times we have seen that the company has ventured into producing smart TV, Bluetooth headphones were already there, and now it has entered into producing wearables. The wearable which we are talking about is the OnePlus Band which we will be reviewing. This is the first product from OnePlus in the wearable segment.DesignThe new OnePlus Band looks just like other fitness bands. It comes with an adjustable strap configuration in a single model. The dimensions of the fitness tracker and the strap are quite similar to other fitness trackers on the market, measuring 40.4×17.6×11.95 mm with a width of up to 21mm which feels very light on the wrist and the straps don’t irritate the skin when you sweat while exercising. With a basic clasp style, the strap features distinctive striated patterns along its length. It’s a shiny, pliant quality that causes the skin to feel good. The default color is black, but extra colored straps can be ordered by the customer. The two other color straps available are Navy and Tangerine Gray. By just pressing lightly, the key tracker can be popped in and out of the strap and the reason for this is that any time you decide to charge the band, you have to pull the tracker out. The tracker and the band are completely water-resistant with an IP68 rating that helps you to use the band even underwater when swimming.DisplayThe OnePlus Band has a 1.1-inch, 126×294 pixel AMOLED touchscreen display. Thanks to its self-emitting pixels, the display has bright, well-saturated colors, and completely deep blacks in terms of picture consistency. Also, in direct sunshine, the screen remains easily readable. The brightness level of the band can also be adjusted which you can opt for according to your brightness preference and the amount of battery power which you want to invest in the display. The OnePlus brand has no button, and the entire surface of the front is plain. There is no always-on display on the OnePlus Band. OnePlus does, however, provide one of the best wake detection displays. The display on the OnePlus Band lights up with the slightest turn of your wrist, unlike most other fitness trackers in this price category that require deliberate and dramatic arm gestures to light up their screens.FunctionsThe new OnePlus Band comes with four main features which are fitness tracking, heart monitor, SpO2 monitor, and the sleep tracker. The band can track various activities like running, fat burn running, open-air walks, cycling, elliptical exercise, rowing, swimming, and many others. The heart monitoring constantly provides you the information about your heartbeat. The band has a built-in pulse oximeter that measures your peripheral oxygen saturation or SpO2 levels. The pulse oximeter is one such important feature that helps you keep a record of the oxygen level especially when you are hypoxic. OnePlus Band is also able to follow your sleep patterns, including your total length of sleep, deep sleep and light sleep, and your SpO2 levels during your sleep. The band can monitor various activities but it misses out on two sensors which are the menstrual cycle sensor and stress sensor. The lack of these two sensors make the band a little less appealing to the customers and place it behind its rival band which is Mi Band 5. All the data recorded can be seen on the OnePlus Health App. The health app allows you to make changes in the settings of the band like changing the watch faces. The new OnePlus band comes with 37 watch faces.The band has other smart features as well which include controlling the music, taking pictures of your paired phone with the band. The band also allows you to set alarms. The notifications of your phone also pops-up on the display of the band as well.BatteryThe OnePlus Band comes with a 100mAh battery and claims to provide up to 14 days of battery life on a single charge but when we used the watch rigorously in its higher settings we were able to use the watch only for 7-8 days. However, if you use the watch in its moderate settings you will be able to use the watch for 12 days with a single charge.ConclusionThe OnePlus Band effortlessly kicks start a new domain for the brand which is cluttered with various offerings from America’s Fitbit to the Chinese Xiaomi and Korea’s Samsung, and like the OnePlus smartphones, this band makes an impact on the first attempt. The band is suitable for the skin, offers a wide range of tracks, from the very demanding oxygen level to your steps, and heartbeat. The 37 watch faces make it fun to wear each day. The battery backup is great and can easily last during long tours without the worry of charge. The display is quite ambient and responsive as well. The ability to control smartphone notifications adds to its benefits. The OnePlus Band sells a"

158,"Last year, Samsung stunned all smartphone geeks in India by launching the Galaxy S10 Lite – a watered-down edition of the Galaxy S10 with the more capable Snapdragon 855 Plus chip, a bigger battery, and (most importantly) a cheaper price tag. It was a hit recipe but Samsung followed it up with the Galaxy S20 FE, which did not impress critics as much as its international 5G variant, courtesy of its Exynos 990 chipset. Samsung now possibly wants to fix that with the Galaxy S20 FE 5G.A report from Pricebaba spotted the Galaxy S20 FE 5G’s support page on Samsung India’s website. The phone was also spotted getting the latest BIS certification, thereby hinting at an imminent launch. The 5G variant is the same as the international variant that used the Snapdragon 865 chip instead of the Exynos 990.Galaxy S20 FE 5G coming to IndiaWhile the Galaxy S20 FE that India got was a good phone overall, it struggled with the inferior Exynos 990 chipset. We reviewed the phone at BGR India and found the phone overheating as well as struggling with resource-intensive games at times. The phone also lacked support for 5G. The international variant, however, got the Snapdragon 865 variant that solved all the issues of the Exynos variant.© Provided by BGR.in Samsung Galaxy S20 FEIn India, the Galaxy S20 FE 5G could retain 95 percent of the same features as the 4G variant, except for the chipset. That means you are going to get the same plastic unibody design with the five-color palette. The display remains the same at 6.5-inches and will offer the same Super AMOLED experience with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The Snapdragon 865 could help with improved battery life, better image processing, and faster performance (obviously).What remains to be seen is how Samsung prices the Galaxy S20 FE 5G in India, given that the 4G variant already sells at a fairly high price of Rs 49,999. It is possible that Samsung could discontinue the Exynos variant and bring the 5G version at a similar price. Samsung could also dip the price of the 4G variant and bring the Snapdragon version at a higher price, or vice versa.Currently, the only Samsung phone in India to use the Snapdragon 865 chip is the ultra-premium Galaxy Z Fold 2 5G. The current-gen Galaxy S21 series is using the Exynos 2100 chipset series."

163,"Poco X3 Pro smartphone has been spotted on several regulatory websites. The device was recently spotted on FCC, EEC certification sites. The IMEI has been registered in India as well which means the device launch is not too far away in India. The Poco X3 will likely be a mid-range phone with flagship processor.According to a report from XDA-Developers , the upcoming Poco devices will be called the Poco X3 Pro and it was spotted on US FCC site with model number “M2102J20SG”. A device with the same model number was also spotted on the IMEI database.(Image credit: Aakash Jhaveri)Further, the report also claims the Poco X3 Pro device is currently code-named “vayu” and “bhima”.

164,"© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game Box Review: Game On, Without Burning A Hole In Your PocketThere is just something about gaming consoles because even those who wouldn’t otherwise like to be referred to as gamers, suddenly want to plant their backsides firmly inside the warm cushiness of a bean bag and spend hours racing on some of the iconic racetracks in the world or spend a lot of time shooting the heads off the zombies who have taken over what remains of the damned world. That being said, not everyone can afford a Sony PlayStation or a Microsoft Xbox console. What if I was to tell you that most of those games you play on the comparatively small screen of your phone, can be made available on your TV as well. A much larger canvas to enjoy games, isn’t it? Albeit most certainly not in the same league as the Xbox and the PlayStation. That’s exactly what the Amkette Evo Game Box does. Irrespective of whether your TV is a smart TV or not, the Evo Fox Game Box simply adds both dimensions to the experience—gaming and video streaming. But how much money will you have to part with?The Amkette Evo Fox Game Box is priced at Rs 8,990 and that makes it significantly less of an outlay for a gaming console than what you may have otherwise imagined. That includes the Nvidia Shield gaming console family, which is perhaps the benchmark in the world of Android TV based media players and gaming consoles, and their price tags also support that fact. Here, the promise is simple. The Evo Fox Game Box can deliver Android gaming that you can enjoy on your TV rather than looking down into your phone. After all, this runs Android 9 which has been heavily reworked for the TV screen. And this can be a one-stop video streaming hub as well, with all the popular video streaming apps available for download via the Google Play Store.© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game BoxThe core specs of the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box include a quad-core processor, a Mali G31 3D graphics chip, 4GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage. If you intend to download a lot of games, and Android games have this bad habit of further downloading a lot of game data at certain points, you’ll fill this up rather quickly. That’s where the microSD card comes into the picture. The thing with the performance is that it is consistently slick, without any apparent slowdowns or stutters. That’s certainly a positive, particularly when you consider that underneath is still a fairly old Android iteration. There are also two USB ports, but those will be populated in a jiffy because the wireless remote control and the wireless game controller both need dongles to connect with the Amkette Evo Game Box. This, while it works well, just feels a tad old school for a gaming console that is attempting to attract gamers in the year 2021.The Amkette Evo Fox Game Box is 4K ready, handles gaming as well at that resolution fairly smoothly. There is still some dependence on the actual game and how its tuned, but I noticed that graphics heavy games such as Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 had occasional stutters and there was some lag in the controller input at 4K, which was sorted as soon as the resolution came to a more controlled 1080p at 60Hz. Yet, at 4K resolution, games such as Ski Safari 2 and Hungry Shark Evolution exhibit absolutely no stutters.© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game BoxA lot of the experience and performance will depend on the game that you intend to play, and whether it can detect the gaming device it is being played on and whether it can adjust and play well with the wireless controller. For instance, the two game titles that I specifically had my attention on the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box are Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3. On the former, the gameplay is fantastic with a very PlayStation 4-esque controller mapping, quick game load times and a very enjoyable experience overall. However, things on the Real Racing 3 title weren’t as smooth. The controller mapping is a bit weird and the game refuses to detect the left turn gesture on the controller. In a Formula 1 race, you wouldn’t last very long if your car refuses to turn left. In the fragmented world that is Android, the Google Play Store and indeed the Android apps and game experience, it is hard to underline an exact strength or weakness of the Amkette Evo Fox Game Box. Nevertheless, what we can say is that it’ll do very well if the game that you intend to run on it has been given enough smarts by the developer. And it’ll be a choppy experience if that isn’t the case.The Amkette Evo Fox Game Box, on its own end, is ready with the hardware and the software to deliver when the right games come along. The good thing is, there are a bunch of preloaded games too across genres, which can get you started with gaming pretty much from the outset. Beyond that, the Google Play Store is your wide canvas.© Provided by News18 Amkette Evo Fox Game BoxOne observation that I really cannot mince words with is the interface. Yes"

208,"The Infinix Smart 5 was launched recently in the sub-Rs. 8,000 price segment as the newest addition to the Smart series. When I unboxed this smartphone, I was surprised to see how big it is, thanks to the bigger-than-usual battery capacity, considering its price. The Smart 5 has some decent specifications on paper, and an attractive starting price of just Rs. 7,199. Does that make it the best pick for those on a very tight budget? I put the Infinix Smart 5 to the test to find out.Infinix Smart 5 designThe Infinix Smart 5₹ 7,199 is physically bigger than most other smartphones in this price range. The front is dominated by a 6.82-inch HD+ display with fairly thick bezels all around. The bottom chin is thicker than the sides, but it's acceptable given the price of the smartphone. At the top of the display sits a selfie camera in the dewdrop notch, along with a big earpiece just above it. This earpiece also doubles up as a loudspeaker. The Smart 5 has a selfie flash that's hidden in between the display and the frame, just like on a few other Infinix smartphones.One of the first things I noticed about the Smart 5 was its weight. At 207g it is among the heaviest smartphones in its price range. A lot of the weight comes from the big 6,000mAh battery. You will notice how bulky this phone is when you pick it up. Infinix has tried to make this less apparent by curving the sides to make gripping the device better.The Smart 5 has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, which I found to be placed slightly higher than ideal. You'll find the power and volume buttons on the right side of the frame. The power button is convenient but reaching the volume buttons might require you to shuffle the phone in your hand. The Smart 5 has the SIM tray on the left, and it has two Nano-SIM slots as well as a microSD card slot.Infinix offers the Smart 5 in four colour options: Morandi Green, 7° Purple, Obsidian Black, and Aegean Blue. I had the Aegean Blue variant for this review. Infinix has gone with a flow pattern on the back of the Smart 5 which pops when light hits it. The back is glossy and is a fingerprint magnet. There is a dual-camera setup at the back, and Infinix has designed it to look like there are three cameras. Thankfully, the module doesn't protrude a lot and sits nearly flush with the rear panel.At the bottom, the Smart 5 has a Micro-USB port, with a 3.5mm headphone jack and the primary microphone on either side. Infinix ships a screen protector in the box along with a plastic case. You also get a 10W charger in the box.Infinix Smart 5 specifications and softwareThe Smart 5 has modest hardware. It is powered by the MediaTek Helio G25 octa-core processor. This processor also powers the Xiaomi Redmi 9A, which is similarly priced. Infinix has paired the Helio G25 with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. There is only one configuration of the Smart 5, so if 2GB of RAM seems inadequate for your needs, you might have to look elsewhere. Storage on the other hand is expandable by upto 256GB using the microSD card slot.Connectivity options on the Smart 5 include Bluetooth 5, VoWiFi, and Dual 4G VoLTE. The phone runs Android 10 with Infinix's custom XOS 7 UI on top. Infinix has made some customisations and you do get a few apps and games preinstalled on the smartphone. Palm Store, an alternative to the Play Store, is one of the preinstalled apps. It kept pushing notifications for different apps and games at least once a day. I couldn't find a way to uninstall the app, but could disable it.The UI on the Infinix Smart 5 is easy to use and I did not have any issues finding what I was looking for. There is theme support and you can customise the UI your way. Infinix has also added a Game Mode on the Smart 5 which turns off auto-brightness and prevents the phone from switching between data and Wi-Fi while you are gaming.Infinix Smart 5 performanceThis is one area in which the Smart 5 might disappoint heavy users. The Helio G25 is capable of handling casual usage, but ramp up the workload and it stutters while delivering. With only 2GB of RAM, there isn't a huge scope for multitasking, and I found the Smart 5 constantly killing apps in the background to keep RAM free. This is expected given the price it is targeted at. For people who only have simple requirements and don't do much at the same time, such as watching videos or using messenger apps, the performance is just about adequate.I found the fingerprint scanner at the back to be accurate, and unlocking the Smart 5 was quick. The phone uses its earpiece as the loudspeaker and I found the volume to be adequate for video watching. The display of the Smart 5 is decent indoors but I found it to be reflective outdoors.The Smart 5 was put through our usual benchmarks, and it managed to score 88,375 in AnTuTu. In PCMark Work 2.0, it scored 5129 points. In Geekbench 5's single-core and multi-core tests, the Smart 5 managed to score 130 and 453 points respectively. The Smart 5 also managed 27fps"
209,"A Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 smartphone has reportedly caught fire in a woman's purse in New York. According to a report by The New York Post, the incident happened earlier this month and now the victim has filed a suit.A Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 smartphone has reportedly caught fire in a woman's purse in New York. According to a report by The New York Post, the incident happened earlier this month and now the victim has filed a suit.According to the report, the woman claimed that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 had gotten extremely hot while she was using it. She then went on to put it in her purse. Soon after that, she heard a weird noise from her bag which she described as ""whistling and screeching"" sounds. This was followed by thick smoke coming out of her handbag.The woman then tried to empty the contents of her purse on an elevator floor but to no avail. The smoke and sounds only stopped after a man picked up the phone with a piece of cloth and put it in a bucket full of water.The new incident re-surfaces the issues that Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owners faced two years ago. The device had to be discontinued within months of its launch. The main issue with the Note 7 was the battery unit. Samsung's initial response was to recall the devices and replace the battery packs. However, some devices that were marked safe also reported cases of fire. The company released a public apology for the same and stopped producing and supplying the Note 7.In the next cycle, Samsung released the Galaxy Note 8. However, this time around, they placed a much smaller battery with a capacity of 3300mAh. The company was trying to play safe but the device owners complained about considerably short battery back-up.This year, Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 9 with a huge 4000mAh battery to keep up with the growing battery standards in the industry. To assure safety to the new buyers, Samsung's head of mobile business, DJ Koh cleared the air by saying that Note 9 batteries are safe and have undergone an 8-step test.In a statement, Samsung claimed that no other incidents related to the Galaxy Note 9 have been reported so far and the company is already investigating the matter. If Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 suffers the same fate as Note 7, the company might have to consider discontinuing the entire line-up."
210,"Oh, no, is Google about to have its Galaxy Note 7 moment? A swathe of Pixel 3 and 3XL owners have reported damage to their handsets due to swollen batteries.According to numerous threads on the Google Support forum and Reddit, bulging batteries are causing the back panels of some Pixel devices to pop off. The threads, which date back to May, were first spotted by AndroidPolice. Curiously, AndroidPolice founder Artem Russakovskii’s Pixel 3 suffered from the same issue.The cause remains unclear, but a common thread between reports is that the swelling appeared shortly after the devices’ wireless charing started to malfunction — or stopped working altogether. Some users are speculating it’s precisely the use of wireless charging and the heat associated with it that’s accelerating the swelling.We’ve reached out to Google to ask about what might be causing the issue, and will update this piece accordingly if we hear back.Aside from the obvious safety hazard, the swelling also compromises the IP68 sealing against water and dust, which could cause further damage to handsets.The good thing is that, according to AndroidPolice, Google seems to be offering free replacements even for devices out of warranty. The company does, however, note this is a one-time deal, and won’t be swapping devices if the issue persists in replacement units.To be fair, battery swelling isn’t a completely uncommon issue — but not for phones only 2 years old. The timing also couldn’t be any worse, with the new Pixel 5 slated to drop later this month, and likely won’t help with Pixel’s ever-dwindling sales.Samsung infamously had to recall and discontinue its Galaxy Note 7 series after its phones began exploding left and right. The company eventually identified two design shortcomings in the battery as the culprit. Fortunately, Pixel owners haven’t reported any explosions so far.Apple, too, had to launch an official probe into its battery design after numerous iPhone 8 owners complained about swelling in their devices back in 2017.Unlike Apple and Samsung, though, Google’s reputation as a phone-maker is still flimsy — and a hardware debacle like this could spell trouble for its already bleeding phone brand.Even after the disastrous Note 7 release, Samsung was able to bounce back almost unscathed. Google, on the other hand, has historically struggled to turn the Pixel into a commercial success in spite of receiving generally positive reviews across the board.Truly, a #batterygate moment is the last thing Google needs ahead of the Pixel 5 launch."
211,"In a recent case of smartphone explosion, a Realme 5 smartphone caught fire and exploded while it was in the user's pocket.  The incident took place in Haryana, India. While this seems like yet another smartphone explosion case leaving the company in a weird position, this time, it turns out that Realme wasn't really at fault. Read on to know more what really happened and what is Realme's reply to the same.Realme 5 caught fireAccording to a report by Mysmartprice, Amit Rathi, a resident of Haryana saw his Realme 5 catching fire when he was riding his bike on March 17 and exploded in no time. Due to this, Rathi experienced minor burns on his as the smartphone was in his pocket when the incident took place.It is suggested that Amit charged his smartphone with the original charger that came with the box and the bill is dated back to October 21, 2019. In addition to this, the report suggests that when taken the case was reported to Realme, a free replacement was offered. However, when the Amit reached to the customer care service, the executive demanded 50% of the total price of the Realme 5.Realme's responseWe, at Indiatvnews.com, contacted Realme and found out the truth indeed. Realme has suggested that the Realme 5 was damaged by external forces due to which the battery was damaged and it eventually caught fire. Realme, in a statement issued to Indiatvnews.com, said, ""The user's phone battery caught fire, and we have analyzed the phone. The phone was badly deformed by external forces, and the battery was punctured, causing the battery to catch fire. From the user's point of view, we have offered him a discount, asking him to replace a new mobile phone with 50% of the cost of his paid mobile phone, but the user did not agree, so he complained to social media. Please note that we are now in further communication with users.""Upon investigating into the matter, Realme provided us with an excel sheet and a couple of images suggesting that the smartphone was broken and deformed due to heavy external force applied on the frame, on the battery position, and another side of the device.As a reminder, recently, a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro also caught fire and blasted. As compensation for the same, Xiaomi gave the victim a free Redmi Note 7 Pro and a Xiaomi Mi backpack.The aforementioned cases are a reminder that we should handle our smartphones with care and ensure they are not subjected to any manhandling so that our smartphones remain safe."

Below you'll find the most widely reported issues along with any fixes for them - which in many cases just means updating your software, because as of iOS 14.4, a lot of the issues have been solved.Don't see your iOS 14 problem listed? We're happy to troubleshoot it with you. Please follow us and share your problem, and we'll either reply or direct message you (if it's a long one) with a solution if we find one.Below, we’ll explain the top iOS 14 problems along with any fixes that have been figured out so far. Some of the issues are solved by simply updating to the latest version of iOS; when we note that an update addressed the issue, consider it fixed for every later version of iOS unless we say otherwise. To update to the latest version, head to Settings > General > Software Update > Download and Install, and click Install Now when the option becomes available.See moreHow to get iOS 14 on your iPhoneiOS 14 text notifications not appearing - SolvedMore and more users are lamenting that text message notifications aren't working properly - specifically, texts are going through, but notification bubbles aren't always popping up. There are reports that even the red bubble may not appear either, even if you have unread texts. It's annoying, irregular, and means you have to fully open your Messages app to manually check if you have new texts or iMessages.iOS 14 problem solved: As part of iOS 14.3, Apple fixed a bug causing message notifications not to be received, so updating to iOS 14.3 or later should solve the problem.iOS 14 won't download on your iPhoneTechnically, you're not on iOS 14 yet, and that's the first major problem. If you have a compatible iPhone, you should be able to get the latest software update. Make sure you're iPhone is the iPhone 6S series or newer.You'll also need enough space on your device to download iOS 14 and the battery needs to be charged. It's best to install iOS 14 when your iPhone is plugged in. If you previously tested the beta, delete that version of the software in Settings > General > Profiles.Battery drains fasterSome users are reporting that, after installing iOS 14, their batteries have drained at an alarming rate, like this iPhone owner in Apple's official forums. This problem hasn't been fixed with an update at the time of writing, and what's more, the update to iOS 14.2 is seemingly causing similar battery issues for other users.While the issue hopefully will be patched, there are things you can do in the meantime.For one thing, this issue regularly happens to some users when they install a new version of iOS. When upgrading to a new version of the operating system, users' iPhones are re-indexing their files and apps so they can find them faster and more efficiently – in other words, this battery drain may just be temporary until your iPhone gets used to the new update. There are other things to look out for if battery loss continues – namely checking if it's lost capacity over time. Head to Settings > Battery > Battery Health to check whether your battery has deteriorated. If so, or if you want to extend battery life generally, there are plenty of Apple-recommended ways to do so, like turning off auto-brightness on your screen (Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations) and manually keeping it at a low setting.You can also turn off apps refreshing in the background (Settings > General > Background App Refresh) and switch off location services within apps (Settings > Privacy > Location Services). Lastly, you can easily toggle off several of the above features just by switching to Low Power Mode (Settings > Battery).Can't add or edit iOS 14 widgetsiOS 14 widgets are the star of this iPhone update, yet you may find it difficult to add or edit widgets. That's certainly an iOS 14 problem, if you ask us. New apps you download may not allow you to add widgets when tapping the + icon in the top right corner (while in jiggle mode). iOS 14 problem solved: While we're not going to consider this fully solved until Apple issues an update to fix the known widgets glitch, here's a quick fix we've found: if you open up the app and play around with it first, then close it, you may find that it appe"
213,"Apple users updating their iPhones to iOS 14.2 are facing severe battery drain issues. The issues seem to have a noticeable impact on older iPhone models such as the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone X, iPhone 7, and the iPhone SE (2020). Alongside the iPhone models, some users updating their iPad to iPadOS 14.2 have also reported similar battery drain issues. Apple hasn't yet provided any clarity on whether the issues would be addressed through a new software update in the coming days.As per the user complaints posted on the Apple Developer Forums, the battery drain issues on the iPhone models cropped up shortly after the release of iOS 14.2 in November. More users started noticing the problems with the passage of time, as brought into notice by a Reddit post. Some of the affected users have also taken to Twitter to highlight the battery issues after installing the iOS 14.2 update.In most cases, the iPhone models running on iOS 14.2 are reportedly seeing battery life dropping quite significantly. People have seen the battery drop over 50 percent in less than 30 minutes, as highlighted in multiple user posts. Some users have also observed a sudden gain in the battery percentage after restarting their devices.“My phone battery was perfectly fine before [the] update,” one of the affected users wrote on the Apple Developer Forums. “Now, it goes to one percent from 70 percent in [a] matter of minutes.”The battery drain issues were mostly observed on older iPhone models, including the iPhone 11, iPhone XR₹ 38,999, iPhone 7₹ 24,999, and the iPhone SE (2020). Some iPad users on older models including the 2018 iPad Pro have also noticed sudden battery drops after updating to iPadOS 14.2 that arrived alongside iOS 14.2 in November.It isn't clear whether there is any impact of the battery drain issues noticed after installing iOS 14.2 on the iPhone 12₹ 79,399 series. However, some iPhone 12 users also recently noticed drastic battery drops as well.Gadgets 360 has reached out to Apple for clarity on a fix regarding the battery drain issues and will update this space when the company responds.Meanwhile, if you haven't yet updated your iPhone to iOS 14.2, it would be worth waiting for the next update that may carry a fix for the reported battery drain issues.This is not the first time when iPhone users have faced battery drain issues after installing a new iOS update. Just in the recent past, some users updating their iPhone models to iOS 14 reported battery life problems. Apple also acknowledged those complaints in October and suggested affected users erase all their content and settings from their iPhones to fix the issues."
214,"Samsung Galaxy M31 — the budget smartphone by the South Korean giant — received a new software update with the April 2020 security patch earlier this week. While the latest software update was meant to provide various security fixes, it appears to have come with some bugs that are causing issues to users. Various affected users reported that their Galaxy M31 bricked while installing the latest update. Some Samsung Galaxy A70 users in the country, who received an Android 10 update along with One UI 2.0, also reported similar issues.As per the user reports on on Twitter, several Samsung Galaxy M31 users ended up bricking their phones while attempting to install the latest update. The handset reportedly gets stuck during the installation process, according to the users.Some of the affected users also reported similar problems on the Samsung Community forums. The affected users highlighted that since the phone gets bricked while installing the new software, they aren't able to even perform a factory restore to fix the problem.Although some users claimed that they were able to resolve the issue after downloading a previous firmware from a third-party source, it isn't recommended as failing to flash the software could cause even serious problems.Similar to the Galaxy M31, some Samsung Galaxy A70₹ 22,999 users in India have also reported similar bricking issues after installing the Android 10 update that comes with One UI 2.0. The problem on the Galaxy A70 was caused by a hardware mismatch, reports SamMobile. However, it isn't likely to be the reason in case of the Galaxy M31.Some reports also suggest that Samsung has halted the update rollout for both the Galaxy M31 and Galaxy A70 to avoid further issues.While Samsung may fix the issue in a future software update, the users whose phones are bricked have no respite until they can reach a company service centre, all of which are closed due to the nationwide lockdown. The company's social media hasn't been much help to the users either. Samsung does have the option to remotely assist its customers, but it is unclear whether the company plans to do that.Gadgets 360 has reached out to Samsung India for a comment on the matter and will update this space when the company responds. Meanwhile, it is advisable to not install the latest update to avoid facing any issues.Samsung Galaxy M31 is one of the company's latest phones in the country as it was launched in February this year."
215,"Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphones that were launched in February seem to have landed in trouble. Several users on social media have recently pointed out that their Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphones are facing GPS-related issues especially while using Google Maps. Samsung has not officially addressed the problem however, some have claimed that the retail showrooms are replacing the units after they reported the issue. The problem also seems to be present in the Galaxy S20 units which used the Snapdragon-powered SoC instead of Samsung's own Exynos SoC. Previously some users also pointed out an issue with the camera of the new smartphones.Samsung Galaxy S20₹ 70,490-series users living in America and Canada have pointed out on social media that while using apps such as Google Maps and Waze, the GPS in the phone was unable to freeze the detected location. A user on Twitter pointed out that despite restarting the phone, the apparent bug did not get fixed. Similarly, other users on Samsung Forums raised the same issues while using Google Maps. A user further claimed that despite turning off and then turning on the GPS, the problem still lingered. ""When using Google Maps or Waze I am getting a searching for GPS message on the screen. I have tried turning location off and back on and rebooting the phone. Not sure what else I can do to fix this issue,"" the user said.After more users addressed the alleged problem on the forum, some further claimed that their Samsung Galaxy S20 units were replaced. At the moment it is unclear whether this is a software bug that is causing the problem or a hardware issue with the handset.Since most of the users who reported the issue are living countries like the US and Canada, we are assuming the alleged bug is present in the Snapdragon-powered units. To recall, Samsung released the Galaxy S20 lineup, which includes the Galaxy S20, the Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra₹ 77,777 with either Samsung Exynos 990 SoC or Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC. The Samsung Galaxy S20 phones that are sold in India use an Exynos-powered processor, unlike the US units which use the Snapdragon processors. This is possibly why we have not come across users complaining about GPS-related issues in the country.Earlier this week, Samsung also tried fixing an auto-focus camera issue that was pointed out by several users. However, it is not fully resolved yet and an update from Samsung is expected in the coming weeks."
216,"Samsung’s just launched Galaxy S20 FE is reportedly giving some grief to users who have bought it. Some of these users are reporting touchscreen issues with the Galaxy S20 FE, and they have taken to Reddit to share their experience. Some have also reported the issues on XDA-Developers Samsung user forums"
217,"Motorola released an update to fix one of the reported issues, though not all users have apparently been addressed so far.Motorola Edge+ has a couple of display issues, as per user reports. While one issue brings smudges to the display, the other one seems to discolour the display and adds a green colour effect. Several users have reported the issue on the Lenovo Forums alongside sharing some images to highlight the problems they're facing with the Motorola Edge+. Lenovo-owned Motorola also seeded an update last week specifically to fix the smudging issue. However, some users have pointed out that despite the new update, they're still facing the problem.“My very new Edge Plus has just started having these purple spots creep onto the screen if it's on for a long period of time,” one of the early affected users reported on the Lenovo Forums late last month. Shortly after the first report emerged online, several users echoed the same smudging problem that brings blacked out spots and green tint on the display panel of the Motorola Edge+.A forum admin quickly responded to the initial set of affected users and promised a software update that would fix the issue. The update reached Verizon customers at the end of last week with a build number QPB30.188-48, reports Droid Life. It included a changelog that specified “improved display contrast and clarity” alongside the June Android security patch.Some users on the Lenovo Forums mentioned that after receiving the latest software update, they weren't able to notice any smudges on the display. However, this isn't the case with all the users who're facing display issues on the Motorola Edge+. A few users said that even after installing the update, they're able to notice some problems with the panel that has dual edges and is one of the unique selling points (USPs) of the new Motorola flagship.The forum admin responded to user complaints by saying that the smudging issue could be corrected through the new software, though there aren't any details around the problem that discolours the screen and brings a green shade on top.“If yours did not clear up, we now recommend exchanging it,” the admin said. “Apparently some displays could be beyond the point of recovery via software.”It is unclear whether the issues are limited to the US variant of the Motorola Edge+ or also available on its global units. Gadgets 360 reached out to Motorola for clarity and received a statement from the company.""We are aware of these isolated Edge+ reports and delivered a solution to affected consumers via a software update. Additionally, we are investigating reports that some active units are still experiencing the issue and ask that these Edge+ owners receive individual actions from the Motorola Support Team,"" the company said in the statement."
218,"The company has rolled out software update to fix it but if that doesn't work people will have get the phones replaced.Motorola Edge+ has got some interesting feedback from consumers since its launch. But the company has got a major scare this week after some users complained about screen issues with the device. People has posted the issue on Motorola forums with images of their phones. Apparently, they are seeing purple patches on the both the sides of the display. Also Read - Motorola One Fusion+ launched in India at Rs 16,999; first Flipkart sale on June 24This makes a huge difference to the colour quality of the screen. The users mentioned that after keeping the phone for a while, they patch disappears but comes back again. The problem seems to have picked up from few users since last month. But now it has spread to a larger number, causing concerns for the company. Also Read - The dual-screen Microsoft Surface Duo smartphone could be announced in late JulyThankfully, the Motorola Forum admin has reached out to all these users. He’s also confirmed that a software update will be rolled out to fix the display issue. Motorola Edge+ users on Verizon have reportedly got a new firmware with display changes mentioned in the log. The update seems to have fixed the issue for few units but not everyone. Also Read - Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 display specs revealedNoticing this, the admin connected with users once again, suggesting the issue might not be fixable with a software update. Instead, the people who’re still facing issues might have to get their device replaced. Motorola launched the Edge+ in India few weeks back, and we’re hoping the company helps the affected users with a better solution in the country.The Motorola Edge+ also features a 6.67-inch full-HD+ curved OLED display with 90Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support and a punch-hole selfie camera design. Internally, it is different from Edge sibling. Motorola has used Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 SoC paired with up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of non-expandable UFS 3.0 storage."
219,"Some Xiaomi and Redmi devices are facing a peculiar issue with many users recently complaining of facing a strange issue that has forced their phones to go on a continuous rebooting loop. This issue has earned the company a lot of heat on social media, with the company still to issue a fix.And now Airtel, the telecom operators whose users also appear to be facing problems because of this issue, has come out and confirmed the issue. Taking to Twitter, Harmeen Mehta, the company's Global CIO, has said that the company is working with Mi India to fix crashing and other issues that some Airtel India users are experiencing with the Xiaomi phones.She further confirmed that while a fix is awaited and will come from Xiaomi end, the telecom operator has put out a small tweak in the Airtel Thanks app to help users. She added in a second tweet that the issue is from Xiaomi's end, and will be fixed once the company releases a new update for Airtel users ""tomorrow"".While the Airtel executive did not explain the issue being faced by users, several Airtel users have taken to the web to report that their devices are stuck in a boot loop after encountering a “Find Device Closed Unexpectedly” error. This issue has left their devices unusable, and as such is proving to be a great source of discomfort to them.As of now, it's only Airtel that's come out and publicly highlighted the issue, with other telecom operators not saying anything on the matter. Earlier, Mi India had also released a statement acknowledging the issue, where it confirmed that it had observed certain Mi and Redmi devices encountering the issue of continuous rebooting. Taking customer feedback into consideration, the company confirmed that its team is working towards fixing the problem at the earliest.In a statement it said, ""It has come to our notice that Mi & Redmi devices are showing an error, causing unwanted rebooting of the device. It has been observed that certain lines of code are misbehaving during an app update. While we are working on fixing the issue with the App developer and rolling out a permanent update by early next week, we have put temporary containment measures in place, over the last 36 hours. This fix may need consumers to get their devices flashed at a service centre. At Mi India, customer experience is the topmost priority and we regret the inconvenience caused to them. As a committed brand, our endeavour is to continue delivering on our consumer expectations, thereby offering best user experience to everyone.”"
220,"Mi, Redmi, and Poco users are facing an issue that puts their phones into a bootloop, making them restart again and again. The problem, which appears to have impacted a large number of users, emerges after the phones receive an error that reads, “Find Device closed unexpectedly.” Although Xiaomi is investigating the issue, the company has noted in a statement that it emerged due to certain lines of code misbehaving during an app update. A fix has also been promised that the company said will reach affected users shortly.As per the user reports on social media, the phones running a MIUI 12.05 Global Stable ROM seem to have chiefly impacted due to the issue. The affected users aren't able to make any changes from their end as the phones start rebooting in the loop. Some users also lost their data as they eventually had to reset their phones. The issue isn't limited to a certain smartphone model and has been reported by a list of Mi, Redmi, and Poco devices, including the Mi 10T Pro, Mi 10, Redmi K20 Pro, Redmi Note 9, Redmi Note 7 Pro, and Poco X3, among others. Also, it isn't likely to be limited to India as a user from Nigeria has also reported an identical problem on Twitter.Xiaomi acknowledged the issue in the statement to Gadgets 360 and said that it was due to an app update. The company also assured that an update would arrive by this week. Meanwhile, some “temporary containment measures” are already in place, according to Xiaomi.“This fix may need consumers to get their devices flashed at a service centre,” the company said. It is, however, unclear whether the fix would cause any data loss to the affected users.Xiaomi didn't provide any clarity on which app is causing the issue to users. However, some users speculate that it came due to the Airtel Thanks app.Airtel Global CIO Harmeen Mehta in a tweet posted on Saturday underlined that the telco had worked with Xiaomi to find the cause and was preparing a fix. She also stated that a small tweak had already been provided in the Airtel Thanks app to temporarily resolve the problem.Having said that, there is no clarity on how the affected users would be able to fix the bootloop issue on their devices. Airtel, on its part, also didn't provide any details on whether it would provide a resolution through a server-side update to the Airtel Thanks app as the issue isn't apparently allowing the users to access the app or install any of its updates from Google Play."
221,"If you inquire for a good phone, almost all time shopkeeper will suggest you Oppo/Vivo. The retailer at the shop gets a higher margin in selling Vivo/Oppo mobile than other brands, and that is why they promote and sells these mobiles.If a person buys oppo or vivo phone, the 10–15% that you pay goes as a commission to the shopkeepers. It means you are paying that 10–15% extra from your pocket.Oppo and Vivo smartphones are not bad at all. But they are not valued for money at all. I think the problem with Oppo and Vivo phones is the price to performance ratio that they have got. These two companies are from the same parent company. Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus are owned by the same company BBK Electronics from China.Let’s look at some examples. OVERPRICEDOppo launched a smartphone Oppo F9 Pro with waterdrop notch and Helio P60 processor at 23,990 rupees. Recently Realme ( Realme was a sub-brand of Oppo, But now it is an independent company ) launched Realme 2 Pro with similar waterdrop notch and with Snapdragon 660 processor at just starting price of 13,990. If we compare both these smartphones, then the processor on the Realme is better than Oppo, and the cameras are also better on Realme. There are 8000 rupees price difference between the 6 GB ram variant of both these smartphones.Why should you pay 8000 more rupees when you are getting better specification at a lower price. Just because Oppo is spending a lot of money for the advertisement. If an Ex-Sub Brand of Oppo can offer the same spec at 8000 rupees lower, then it is clear that the extra money we are spending on the Oppo devices is just because of the advertising and marketing.Now let’s talk about Vivo. Vivo V11 Pro, a new smartphone from the brand at the price of 25,990 rupees. With the Same Snapdragon 660 processor. Realme is offering this processor at 13,990 rupees. Xiaomi is offering this processor in one of the best smartphone Mi A2 at 16,999 rupees. Then why should you pay extra money for that? No doubt that Vivo V11 Pro comes with In-display fingerprint sensor, which is a new technology to unlock the smartphone. So if you want to unlock your smartphone in a futuristic way then pay extra money. Otherwise, Poco F1 with Snapdragon 845 flagship SOC is available at just 21,000 rupees. 4,000 less than what Vivo is pricing for the Snapdragon 660.BUILD QUALITYOppo/Vivo smartphones are always in eye-catching glossy colours which looks good, but it’s plastic after all. It does not feel premium in hand.Two years ago I purchased Redmi 3s Prime at rupees 8,999 rupees. One of my friends bought Oppo F1 plus smartphone somewhere near 20,000 rupees. I’m still using the device without any problem, and I’m getting the latest security updates while the fingerprint sensor of Oppo F1 plus had stopped working in just a year. Xiaomi offered better specification at half of the price. OPERATING SYSTEMColorOS (with only colours) and FuntouchOS (no fun to touch) is their heavily skinned OS based on Android. They both look identical to each other, but they’re unprofessional mixing of Android and iOS. Both companies are known for poor software maintenance and updates, expect no significant Android upgrade because they don’t make one, once it’s Nougat, it always is Nougat. Still, they only roll out bug fixes and performance improvements to their phones; they only inject new software to their latest models. NOT VALUE FOR MONEY DEVICESOne of my friends purchased Oppo F5 Youth at 15k rupees. From cameras to the processor, nothing seems good on that device. I’ve compared it side by side with Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro ( Price 15k ), and the difference was huge. Oppo is known as Selfie Expert, but the only megapixel is big in numbers on their smartphones, the picture quality is not good. I mean the picture looks good just because of higher brightness and saturation level, but there is a lack of details and sharpness.These brand should stop wasting money on brand ambassadors; instead, they should give better specification at honest pricing. Every single brand, including Samsung ( Excluding Apple ! ), are making better devices, and they are continuously decreasing the price.If one brand offers you a better device at a lower price, then why should you buy an Oppo or Vivo smartphone?Oppo and Vivo are continuously trying to decrease the price and give a better product to us. But still, they need more improvements. One thing I like about these smartphones is the after-sale service. If you find any issue with these smartphones, you can go to the nearest mobile shop, and the problem will be fixed very soon.Before visiting the nearest mobile shop, have a look at Flipkart and Amazon, maybe you’ll get more value for your money."
